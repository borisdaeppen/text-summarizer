<b>Why do I keep seeing the same page during a split test?</b><br />
<br />
During a split test, users will see the same page they initially saw if they revisit your link. This is to ensure the most accurate split test results possible.<br />
<br />
Other less sophisticated systems just show the user a random page each time, but introducing this type of randomness just makes your results less accurate.<br />
<br />
Just keep in mind this applies to you as well&mdash;you will always see the same page because you will look like a returning visitor to ClickMagick each time you try to test your split test.<br />
<br />
If you want to test that you&rsquo;ve set up your split test correctly, you need to make yourself look like a new unique user each time you click on your split-test tracking link.<br />
