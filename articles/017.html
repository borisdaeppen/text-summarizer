<b>So what can I do with these MagickBars?</b><br />
<br />
Pretty much whatever you want!<br />
<br />
As with pop ups, the sky is the limit and you have full control over the content of your MagickBars.<br />
<br />
It really depends on what you&rsquo;re trying to do, but MagickBars are great for things like ...
<ul>
	<li class="feature">Offering a bonus on an affiliate page</li>
	<li class="feature">Highlighting something on your own site</li>
	<li class="feature">Prominently displaying links on any page</li>
	<li class="feature">Grabbing the users attention with audio</li>
	<li class="feature">Creating urgency with a countdown timer</li>
	<li>Building your list with an opt-in form</li>
</ul>
Unlike pop ups, MagickBars stick around unless the user closes them (if you allow them to) &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; so they&rsquo;re perfect for highlighting or reminding users about something, or for showing any other message or content you want to keep in front of them.
