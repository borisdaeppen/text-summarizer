<b>Can you figure out my &ldquo;solo ad&rdquo; discrepancies?</b><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is one thing we can&rsquo;t do for you.<br />
<br />
However, we&rsquo;ve put together an extremely detailed guide that covers everything we know on the topic, so you can hopefully figure out the problem on your own.<br />
<br />
You can find that here:<br />

Again, please understand that everything we know is fully detailed at the link above. You could hold a gun to our heads and we simply couldn&rsquo;t tell you anything else.<br />
<br />
After reading the above, the only thing left is for you to spend the time it takes to figure out the problem.<br />
<br />
There&rsquo;s nothing we can do that you can&rsquo;t do for yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Why can&rsquo;t you figure out my discrepancies for me?</b><br />
<br />
In case you haven&rsquo;t figured it out yet, the solo ad world is a pretty sketchy &ldquo;industry.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s full of crooks and scammers (some who are VERY sophisticated), and due to the way most people operate their solo ad businesses it also has a bunch of other inherent and oftentimes unsolvable problems.<br />
<br />
Some of these problems are quite technical in nature, and even solo ad &ldquo;gurus&rdquo; who&rsquo;ve been doing this for years have no clue what these problems really are or how to solve them.<br />
<br />
Discrepancies can also take TONS of time to figure out (when it&rsquo;s even possible). Sometimes hours.<br />
<br />
Based on all of the above, this is just not something we can spend our time and resources on.<br />
<br />
We&rsquo;d have to at least DOUBLE our prices for solo ad users to do this, but solo ad users wouldn&rsquo;t pay those prices so it&rsquo;s kind of a Catch-22.<br />
<br />
But that&rsquo;s the long and short of it &hellip;<br />
<br />
If you want to play the solo ad game you&rsquo;re going to have to get really good at this type of thing on your own.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>&ldquo;I just know it&rsquo;s a problem with ClickMagick!&rdquo;</b><br />
<br />
Sorry, but it&rsquo;s really not.<br />
<br />
We have a <strong><a href="/status.cgi#bounty" target="_blank">Bug Bounty Program</a></strong> where we pay $1,000+ to anyone who can find bugs in our system, and in the past 3 years no one has submitted any &ldquo;proof&rdquo; or documentation showing any related problem with ClickMagick &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; for the simple reason that there are none.<br />
<br />
ClickMagick always has been, and always will be, the most accurate click tracker for &ldquo;solo ads&rdquo; on the planet.<br />
<br />
If anyone says otherwise they&rsquo;re lying to you. Guaranteed.<br />
<br />
(Most likely they&rsquo;re one of the scammers for whom we&rsquo;ve made life more difficult. We&rsquo;ve made it much harder to scam people, so they like to bad-mouth us from time to time).
