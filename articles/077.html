<br />
If what you&rsquo;re promoting doesn&rsquo;t support tracking pixels, Postback URLs or Sub-ID tracking, you have to get a little creative in order to track your conversions.<br />
<br />
We generally recommend something that we simply refer to as the &ldquo;Bonus Page&rdquo; method.<br />
<br />
To implement the &ldquo;Bonus Page&rdquo; method, simply come up with some type of bonus for people to claim after they&rsquo;ve made their purchase.<br />
<br />
The bonus&nbsp;could be a free phone consultation, a free eBook, a complimentary webinar, a WordPress plugin, or anything else that might make sense for your buyers.<br />
<br />
All you have to do is add your ClickMagick tracking pixel to the bonus&nbsp;page&nbsp;so that ClickMagick will record the sale whenever someone visits the bonus page to claim their &ldquo;prize.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
This approach won&rsquo;t be 100% accurate because not everyone will visit your bonus page. But, if you give people a compelling reason to visit your bonus page, this workaround works very well, especially when you can&rsquo;t use the standard options for tracking: tracking pixels, Postback URLs, and sub-IDs...
