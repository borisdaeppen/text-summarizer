<strong>Can I show a favicon with my cloaked custom domain?</strong><br />
<br />
A <em>favicon</em> is a small icon that is associated with a website or web page that browsers display in different ways to web visitors, most commonly displaying it in or near the address bar.<br />
<br />
Right now, there is no way to set a favicon with your cloaked custom domain. This is a feature we may add in the future if there is enough interest in it, but at the moment, there are no immediate plans to support favicons for cloaked custom domains.<br />
<br />
If you have a strong need for favicons, please submit a ticket to our <strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support</a></strong> desk and let us know what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish so we can gauge the interest. Thanks!
