<b>How can I do &ldquo;content locking&rdquo; with pop ups?</b><br />
<br />
&ldquo;Content locking&rdquo; is a tactic where you force the user to enter their email address&nbsp;or take some other action before they can access certain valuable content.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s a great way to build your list, get more Facebook &ldquo;likes&rdquo;, and things of that nature &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; and you can easily do this with ClickMagick pop ups&nbsp;which we call MagickPops.<br />
<br />
Just set up a tracking link with the Primary URL pointing to a pre-sell or some other page, then cloak the link and add a pop up &ldquo;on load&rdquo; with an opt-in form for example.<br />
<br />
And make sure that you set the pop up&rsquo;s &ldquo;Closable&rdquo; setting to &ldquo;No&rdquo; for maximum effect&nbsp;otherwise the user will be able to easily bypass the pop up.<br />
<br />
The pop-up will &ldquo;dim&rdquo; and obscure the page behind it, so the user has no choice but to interact with the pop up.<br />
<br />
You would then set the &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; page URL after they opt-in to the URL of the content the user is trying to access, and voil&agrave;&mdash;that&rsquo;s content locking.
