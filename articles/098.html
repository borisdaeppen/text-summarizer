<b>What is the IP Lookup tool used for?</b><br />
<br />
The IP Lookup tool is found in the Tools menu at the top of every page, and you can use it to view the history and activity for any IP address.<br />
<br />
... not only in your own account, but across the entire ClickMagick platform if you want!<br />

It shows all the clicks, actions, sales, etc. along with a timestamp for each event, and is especially helpful in identifying and/or confirming suspicious clicks.
