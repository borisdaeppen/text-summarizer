<strong>What if I need to track more than 1M clicks per month?</strong><br />
<br />
ClickMagick&rsquo;s highest plan allows for up to 1 million clicks per month. We allow you a 10% &ldquo;overage&rdquo; for free, which gives you a true maximum limit of 1,100,000 clicks per month.<br />
<br />
If you need to track more traffic than that you&rsquo;ll simply need to set up multiple accounts and split up your tracking between them, so that no single account gets more than 1.1M clicks per month.<br />
<br />
If you were directed to this FAQ because you&rsquo;ve gone over this limit, and you want help figuring out the best way to split up your tracking between multiple accounts, just let us know and we&rsquo;ll be glad to help.<br />

<strong>Why are ClickMagick plans limited to 1M clicks per month?</strong><br />
<br />
99.9% of all online marketers get less than 1 million clicks per month, and this is ClickMagick&rsquo;s target audience.<br />
<br />
Supporting high-volume accounts over 1M clicks per month requires a completely different infrastructure, different product design and a different business model that we have simply chosen not to pursue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Any exceptions? Can&rsquo;t I just pay you more money?</strong><br />
<br />
Unfortunately not. Because no matter how much money you paid us, you&rsquo;d still be using a product that was not built to accommodate the volume of traffic you get which wouldn&rsquo;t be good for either of us.<br />
<br />
If you can&rsquo;t split up your traffic between multiple accounts for some reason, you&rsquo;ll probably want to look into some better solutions for high-volume tracking.<br />
<br />
We can recommend Voluum which has a great reputation for high-volume tracking, and their lowest plans START at 1M clicks per month.
