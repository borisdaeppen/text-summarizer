<b>What should I never do with a rotator?</b><br />
<br />
You should never spawn multiple windows, tabs or iframes that point to ClickMagick rotators at the same time.<br />
<br />
If you do, your URLs are NOT guaranteed to rotate properly because when a browser client (your user&rsquo;s browser) sends multiple requests to a web server (ClickMagick), the requests are not necessarily processed in any particular order.<br />
<br />
This rarely works as intended on most mobile devices, and many users have browser plug-ins or security software that also prevent multiple windows from spawning at the same time, so the number of actual &ldquo;clicks&rdquo;&nbsp;you get to your rotators is going to be completely random as well.<br />
<br />
99.9% of the time we see this it&rsquo;s done via hidden iframes to generate additional (worthless) clicks to &ldquo;solo ad&rdquo; customers, and since there&rsquo;s no legitimate reason for this it&rsquo;s not something ClickMagick can support.
