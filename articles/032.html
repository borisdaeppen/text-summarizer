<b>Can you explain exactly how SmartSwap works?</b><br />
<br />
SmartSwap is a simple but powerful feature that we invented to help people who do &ldquo;ad swaps&rdquo; and &ldquo;click swaps&rdquo; maximize the value of every click.<br />
<br />
Without SmartSwap technology, when you do an ad swap with someone you&rsquo;ll often send them a lot of clicks from people who have already seen their offer or opted-in to their list, and vice versa.<br />
<br />
This is just a huge waste of clicks for everyone.<br />
<br />
While not a big problem if both sides get a ton of traffic and/or have large lists, this is a very real problem if one or both swap &ldquo;partners&rdquo; don&rsquo;t &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; and the smaller the lists, the bigger the problem.<br />
<br />
SmartSwap solves this problem. Here&rsquo;s how it works &hellip;<br />
<br />
When you want to do a swap with someone, explain to them how ClickMagick&rsquo;s SmartSwap feature will ensure they get the most new, unique visitors possible.<br />
<br />
Just instruct them to send you the agreed upon number of clicks first to one of your ClickMagick tracking links or rotators, so SmartSwap can do its job.<br />
<br />
Then when it&rsquo;s your turn to send them clicks back &hellip;<br />
<br />
Simply set up another tracking link or add their URL to one of your rotators and enable SmartSwap by selecting the link or rotator that THEY sent YOUR clicks to.<br />
<br />
When you do, ClickMagick will make sure that you don&rsquo;t send them back any users that they sent to you first &hellip;<br />
<br />
Completely eliminating wasted clicks on both sides.<br />

<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> When using SmartSwap, make sure you have an appropriate Backup URL set up, because under some situations the system will need to send a user to your Backup URL when it needs to separate that user out and there&rsquo;s nowhere else to send them.</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div class="faq-tip"><b>Tip:</b> To get the most from SmartSwap, make sure your swap partner sends ALL the agreed upon number of clicks BEFORE you start sending clicks to them.</div>
