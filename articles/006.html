<b>How does ClickMagick monitor my traffic quality?</b><br />
<br />
No matter where your traffic is coming from, it&rsquo;s always a good idea to keep an eye on your traffic &ldquo;quality&rdquo;.<br />
<br />
This is determined primarily by WHERE in the world it&rsquo;s coming from, and how many UNIQUE visitors you&rsquo;re actually receiving vs. the total number of clicks.<br />
<br />
This is especially important if you&rsquo;re buying solo ads, clicks from a traffic &ldquo;broker&rdquo;, or any other source that may not be 110% trustworthy because unfortunately, a lot of times they don&rsquo;t deliver what they promise.<br />
<br />
For example, many solo ad sellers will claim something like &ldquo;80%+ T1 clicks,&rdquo; where T1 usually refers to &ldquo;Tier 1&rdquo; traffic from the US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand.<br />
<br />
This is usually the type of traffic you want, but many solo ad sellers will actually send you 50%&mdash;or less&mdash;good T1 traffic, and the rest of the clicks will be from other countries.<br />
<br />
Other times traffic sellers will send you what we call &ldquo;junk traffic,&rdquo; which is really low quality traffic from sites like traffic exchanges, adf.ly, etc. Worse yet, there are outright scammers out there who will send you bogus traffic from 3rd-world click farms (often hiding behind US or other &ldquo;Tier 1&rdquo; proxies) or completely fake and worthless &ldquo;bot&rdquo; traffic.<br />
<br />
ClickMagick will automatically reject traffic from sites that are known to generate junk traffic, so before you spend your money on clicks, check out our list of rejected traffic sources:<br />
