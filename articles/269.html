<strong>What if I can&#39;t find a user in our system?</strong><br />
<br />
This can be tricky sometimes, so you&#39;ll first want to make sure you&#39;ve exhausted all of your options.<br />
<br />
The first, most obvious pieces of information to try would be the E-mail address they used for writing into our help desk and the last name that appears in the ticket.<br />
<br />
Beyond this, you&#39;ll likely find one of the following scenarios.
<ol>
	<li>The user has only created an affiliate account, and not a user account. Try checking to see if they&#39;ve created an affiliate account by doing an affiliate search with their E-mail address or last name.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>They started to create account but didn&#39;t complete the full sign up process. In this case, they don&#39;t have an account yet (they&#39;ll need to start from the beginning).<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The user is writing in from a completely different name and/or E-mail address. If this is the case, you can check the body of their ticket to see if there&#39;s a signature including a different name. If so, try searching for this name to see if perhaps you can find an account they may be referencing.</li>
</ol>
If you&#39;ve exhausted all of these options... your next step is to simply respond letting them know you&#39;re having difficulties finding the account in reference.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can ask them to provide to provide the following information to help search.
<ol>
	<li>The last four digits of the credit card used in the sign up process<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The E-mail address they may have used in signing up<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Their username (if they can remember it)<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Their IP address (by going to http://whatismyip.com)</li>
</ol>
If you still can&#39;t find an account after verifying the above information&hellip; it&#39;s safe to say they don&#39;t have one and may be confusing us with another service like Clickfunnels or Clickbank (this does happen!)
