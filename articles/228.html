<strong>Can I use ClickMagick with Pinterest?</strong><br />
<br />
You can, but you have to be careful. Pinterest does NOT allow &ldquo;third party tracking redirects&rdquo;, so that means you MUST use a cloaked custom domain for your tracking links that you want to use on Pinterest.<br />
<br />
Make sure that both your custom domain and your individual tracking links are set to Cloaked, otherwise your links will redirect through our generic clkmg.com domain. This would be considered a &ldquo;third party tracking redirect&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s exactly what Pinterest says they don&rsquo;t allow.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can also use any funnel entry links you&rsquo;ve created for use with a FunnelMagick funnel, since these links points straight to your site and don&rsquo;t redirect through ClickMagick at all.
