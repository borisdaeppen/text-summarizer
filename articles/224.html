<strong>What is a Link ID or Rotator ID?</strong><br />
<br />
When you create a new tracking link or a rotator link, you need to give that link or rotator a unique ID so that ClickMagick knows which tracking link or rotator to send your clicks to.<br />
<br />
For example, a standard tracking link looks like this:<br />
<br />
<code>http://www.clkmg.com/$username/<em>linkID</em></code><br />
<br />
The <code>linkID</code> part of that tracking link will be different for every tracking link you create and you choose what the <code>linkID</code> will be when you create your tracking link:<br />

<br />
<br />
Because every tracking link has a unique Link ID, ClickMagick knows exactly where to redirect clicks to when they hit your account. A Link ID kinda like the address on your house&mdash;without your actual address, the post office has no way to deliver your mail...<br />
<br />
A Rotator ID is exactly like a Link ID, but for rotators.
