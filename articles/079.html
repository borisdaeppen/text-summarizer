<b>How can I report an IP address I think is a bot?</b><br />
<br />
If you come across what you think is a bot that our system isn&rsquo;t aware of yet, we&rsquo;d really appreciate it if you could report it to us so we can take a look and add it to our auditing system if necessary.<br />
<br />
<b>To report an IP address you think is suspicious</b>, simply click on the IP address and then click the &ldquo;Report it&rdquo; link right near the top of that page.<br />
<br />
Once you report an IP address it will undergo a manual review and if we determine it&rsquo;s a bot we&rsquo;ll add it to the global system-wide click auditing system.<br />
<br />
With your help our bot detection system will continue to get smarter and smarter as each day passes, and we thank you in advance for reporting any suspicious IPs.
