<strong>How do multiple custom domains work with tracking links?</strong><br />
<br />
When you add a custom domain to the Domain Manager, you can instantly use that domain with all your tracking or rotator IDs. You do NOT need to go and select the new domain in each tracking or rotator link for it to work with that link.<br data-text="true" />
<br />
For example, suppose this tracking link already works:<br data-text="true" />
<br />
<code>http://www.clkmg.com/username/baseball</code><br data-text="true" />
<br />
The second you add a new domain, say&nbsp;<code>myfavoriteteam.com</code>, to the Domain Manager, it will instantly work with all existing links, meaning that<br data-text="true" />
<br />
<code>http://myfavoriteteam.com/baseball</code><br data-text="true" />
<br />
will work even if you don&#39;t go and edit the &ldquo;baseball&rdquo; link to specify the new <code>myfavoriteteam.com</code>&nbsp;domain.<br data-text="true" />
<br />
Just adding the domain to the Domain Manager allows the domain to work.<br data-text="true" />
<br />
To emphasize this point even more, if you have 10 tracking domains in the Domain Manager, all 10 tracking domains, plus the ClickMagick tracking domain <code>www.clkmg.com/username/</code>&nbsp;will work interchangeably with the same <code>/baseball</code> link ID.<br data-text="true" />
<br />
Allowing users to select the domain in the link or rotator settings is just &ldquo;eye candy.&rdquo; There&#39;s no actual requirement that they do that... In fact, for marketing reasons, they might want to use a different domain for different places that they use the link.
