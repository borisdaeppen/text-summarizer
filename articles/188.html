<strong>What is a Funnel page Variation URL?</strong><br />
<br />
With certain setups you may have multiple web pages that you want FunnelMagick to treat as a single page in your funnel &ndash;&nbsp;and Variation URLs are the way to do it.<br />
<br />
For example, say you&rsquo;re running paid ads on both Google and Facebook and you have a slightly different landing page for each &ndash;&nbsp;for compliance or conversion reasons &ndash;&nbsp;which is the start of your funnel.<br />
<br />
To track this type of a setup just create the entry page of your funnel in FunnelMagick using one of the URLs, and then set up a Variation using the other URL and ClickMagick will do the rest.<br />

<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> Funnel page variations have&nbsp;nothing at all to do with split testing &ndash;&nbsp;which is a completely separate functionality.</div>
