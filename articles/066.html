<b>Can I track email follow-ups for my funnel too?</b><br />
<br />
You sure can!<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;re using ClickMagick&rsquo;s advanced &ldquo;Entry Link&rdquo; setting of your tracking link, you can easily track the email follow-ups to your funnel.<br />
<br />
Just create a tracking link for each email in your follow-up sequence, and be sure to add it to the primary link group for the funnel you want to associate the emails with.<br />
<br />
The only other thing you have to do is make sure you <b>include the word &ldquo;email&rdquo;</b> somewhere in the &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; link name for any email tracking links &hellip;<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
... and that will allow the system to track conversions from your follow-ups as part of your overall funnel.<br />
<br />
To see how this is done, watch this video which will show you exactly how to set up your email tracking links:<br />
