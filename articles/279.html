<strong>How do you use canned responses?</strong><br />
<br />
For tickets that are common questions in the help desk, chances are there&rsquo;s a canned response to handle that particular ticket which you can use for your reply instead of typing the same response over and over.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In order to use a canned response you&rsquo;ll use the <code>/c</code>&nbsp;command in the text editor.<br />
<br />
This will then open a search box you can use to search for the canned response you&rsquo;d like to use.<br />
<br />
For example, if you were to type &ldquo;refund&rdquo; you&#39;d see the available canned responses to this search query.<br />
