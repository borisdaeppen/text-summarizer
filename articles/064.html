<b>How do I completely hide my referers?</b><br />
<br />
If you want to hide or &ldquo;blank&rdquo; your referers so the sites you&rsquo;re sending traffic to can&rsquo;t tell where it&rsquo;s coming from, it&rsquo;s super easy to do &hellip;<br />
<br />
Just go into the Advanced Settings for any link or rotator and check the box that says &ldquo;Blank Referrers&rdquo; near the bottom, save your changes, and that&rsquo;s all there is it it.<br />
<br />
<b>Important:</b> This requires an extra redirect which technically increases the time it takes for the user to see the page you&rsquo;re sending them to.<br />
<br />
<b>Please do NOT enable this</b> unless you understand the purpose of it, and you have a good reason for using it.
