<b>What are all the advanced rotator settings?</b><br />
<br />
In the Rotator Advanced Settings, you have many ways to fine-tune exactly how your rotators behave and what type of traffic your URLs will receive.<br />
<br />
Some of the settings are processed in a specific order. Read the note at the end of this document for more details.<br />
<br />
For a video overview of the most commonly used features watch this video:<br />

<b>MagickBars &amp; MagickPops</b><br />
<br />
MagickBars and MagickPops are cool features that you can easily add to any rotator or URL in the rotator to increase your conversions.<br />
<br />
With MagickBars, you can add customized content to the top or bottom of any website that you link to. ClickMagick makes it super simple to add countdown timers, email opt-in forms, banner ads, or anything else you can think of to add to a page.<br />
<br />
MagickPops allow you to open a pop up window on top of the target page in a variety of situations. Want an opt-in form to pop up when a user first goes to the page? You can do that. Want a pop up to display if the user tries to leave the page? You can do that too. And those are just two of the options.<br />
<br />
You can add MagickBars and MagickPops to pages you have no control over which make them perfect for affiliate marketers.<br />
<br />

<b>Geotargeting</b><br />
<br />
If you only want to send clicks from certain countries to your rotator URLs, geotargeting allows you to select those countries. All clicks coming from other countries will be sent to the rotator&rsquo;s Backup URL.<br />
<br />
You can learn more about geotargeting here:<br />

<div class="faq-caution"><b>Caution:</b> Any&nbsp;geotargeting settings in the advanced settings of a rotator will take precedence&nbsp;over any geotargeting settings that you have in the&nbsp;rotator URLs themselves. For example, if the rotator itself is set to only accept T1 clicks, your rotator URLs will never receive clicks from non-T1 countries regardless of their geotargeting settings.</div>
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>Mobile URL and iOS URL</b><br />
<br />
You can easily identify mobile clicks by setting the optional Mobile and iOS URLs in the Advanced Settings of any rotator.<br />
<br />
When ClickMagick receives a mobile click, it first checks to see if the click is from an Apple iOS device like an iPhone, and if so, the click is re-routed to the URL specified in the iOS URL setting if there is one.<br />
<br />
If the iOS URL is not set, or the click is from any other mobile device, the click is re-routed to the Mobile URL, again if there is one, otherwise the click is processed normally.<br />
<br />
By default, visitors using tablets like an iPad will be treated as if they&rsquo;re on a desktop PC. This is usually what you&rsquo;ll want because their screens are usually big enough to be treated as a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; visitor. But you can change this any time in the Traffic settings of your <strong><a href="/user/profile.cgi?cat=traffic" target="_blank">User Profile</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Pixel/Code</b><br />
<br />
Add retargeting or other pixels here. Cut and paste carefully, and be sure to test. If you mess this up it can cause your rotator to malfunction.<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> Also, please note that pixels will only fire if the click is sent to your rotator URLs. They will NOT fire if the click is sent to your Backup URL, or any other re-routed URL.</div>
<br />
<br />
<b>&ldquo;Bad&rdquo; Clicks</b><br />
<br />
There are 6 types of &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; or potentially bad clicks you might not want processed the same way as a regular click from a real person surfing the web normally&hellip;<br />
<br />
In the Advanced Settings, you can select how you want ClickMagick to handle each of the 6 types of &ldquo;bad&rdquo; clicks for you, on a per link basis. To set global defaults for these settings visit your <strong><a href="/user/profile.cgi?cat=auditing" target="_blank">User Profile</a></strong> page.<br />

<b>Blank Referrers</b><br />
<br />
If you want to hide or &ldquo;blank&rdquo; your referrers so the sites you&rsquo;re sending traffic to can&rsquo;t tell where it&rsquo;s coming from, it&rsquo;s super easy to do. Just check the box that says &ldquo;Blank Referrers.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
This is an advanced feature that you should avoid using unless you fully understand its purpose and you have a good reason for doing so. For a complete explanation, including cautions, see:<br />

<b>SmartSwap in your Rotator URLs</b><br />
<br />
The SmartSwap feature was introduced specifically for Solo Ad sellers who want to intelligently swap traffic with other Solo Ad sellers.<br />
<br />
The principle is simple: after a seller sends you clicks, ClickMagick remembers those clicks, and when you send clicks back, ClickMagick won&rsquo;t send any clicks from users that you received from the other seller. Obviously this works best if you&rsquo;re both ClickMagick users with SmartSwap enabled as it will ensure that you&rsquo;re only passing unique clicks to each other.<br />
<br />
