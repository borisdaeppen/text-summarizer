<b>How are ClickMagick timers &ldquo;intelligent?&rdquo;</b><br />
<br />
ClickMagick offers two types of timers &hellip;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Evergreen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Date-Based.&rdquo;<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Date-Based timers should be pretty self-explanatory &ndash; you simply enter some date in the future and the timer will count down for all users to that date and time.<br />
You&rsquo;d use this if you wanted to make a special offer that had to expire on a specific day and time.<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Evergreen&rdquo; timers on the other hand are &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo;, meaning they&rsquo;re customized for each user.<br />
<br />
Say you want to make a special offer to all your users that expires in &ldquo;48 hours.&rdquo; You send out an email to your list and announce your special offer &hellip;<br />
<br />
With a normal timer, if someone doesn&rsquo;t click that link in your email for say 36 hours, by the time they get to your page there&rsquo;s only 12 hours left on the timer.<br />
<br />
That may not be ideal for what you&rsquo;re trying to do, and it&rsquo;s why you might want to use Evergreen timers.<br />
<br />
Evergreen timers don&rsquo;t start counting down until a user actually clicks that link and visits your page &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; and on top of that, they &ldquo;remember&rdquo; when each user started the countdown, so that when they return later the countdown is still accurate and doesn&rsquo;t start over.<br />
<br />
This is the most ethical way to use countdown timers, users will respect you for it, and they&rsquo;ll know you mean what you say when you make a limited time offer.
