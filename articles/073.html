<b>What&rsquo;s Engagement Tracking and how can I use it?</b><br />
<br />
Engagement tracking is similar to tracking &ldquo;actions,&rdquo; and you can use it to literally track anything you want.<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;re already tracking opt-ins for example, you can use Engagement Tracking to track webinar registrations, downloads, or anything else you can think of.<br />
<br />
Another great use of Engagement tracking is to simply track clicks on one or more &ldquo;key&rdquo; links.<br />
<br />
For example, say you buy a lot of &ldquo;solo ads&rdquo; and send your traffic to a landing page with an opt-in form &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; And after people opt-in they see a &ldquo;Thank You&rdquo; page with some content and maybe 3 outgoing links on it.<br />
<br />
You can track the opt-ins using the standard &ldquo;Action&rdquo; tracking pixel, but you can also use Engagement tracking to track all the clicks on your outgoing links &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; in which case your Engagement Conversion Rate or ECR would be a great indicator of the quality of traffic you&rsquo;re receiving from each solo ad provider.<br />
<br />
(To do this you&rsquo;d simply add the Engagement tracking pixel to the Pixel/Code section of the tracking links for your outgoing links on your &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; page.)<br />
<br />
This can also help identify fraudulent traffic where the seller is generating fake opt-ins to make their traffic look real (an increasingly common practice unfortunately).<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;re tracking all your outgoing links and a solo ad provider sends traffic with a 40% opt-in rate but a 0% engagement rate, you know the traffic is all fake.<br />
<br />
Your imagination is the only limit with Engagement tracking. If you think of a cool way to use it please let us know so we can share it with the community.<br />
<br />
To find your Engagement tracking pixel simply select &ldquo;Track Conversions&rdquo; from the drop-down menu to the right of any tracking link in your account.
