<strong>How do I delete a link or a link group?</strong><br />
<br />
If you want to delete a tracking link, it&rsquo;s really simple. Just click on the Edit menu <img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/pencil.png"> to the right of any link and choose <strong>Delete Link</strong> from the drop down menu:<br />

To delete a Link Group&mdash;which does NOT delete the links themselves&mdash;go to the <strong>Tools</strong> menu at the top of every page and select the <strong><a href="/user/groups.cgi" target="_blank">Group Manager</a></strong>. From there, choose the <strong>Delete Groups</strong> option. Choose the link group you want to delete, then click the <strong>Delete Group</strong> button:<br />

If you want to delete the group and all of the links within it, the easiest way is to first select the group on the <strong>Links</strong> page to show only the links in the group, then delete each link. Finally delete the group itself.
