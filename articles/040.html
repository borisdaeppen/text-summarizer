<b>Does ClickMagick have an affiliate program?</b><br />
<br />
Absolutely! And it&rsquo;s a great one too.<br />
<br />
You get 100% commission on each referral&rsquo;s first payment after the 14-day free trial, and then 35% each month after that for life. Our average user stays with ClickMagick for quite a long time, so this adds up pretty quick.<br />
<br />
And on top of that, you can get paid DAILY via PayPal.<br />
<br />
For all the details, and to sign up, just click below:<br />

Inside the Affiliate area, you can see all your stats and you can find marketing materials such as done-for-you banners.<br />

<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> The affiliate system is separate from your ClickMagick account, so you will need to create a separate affiliate account at the link above.<br />
<br />
Your <b>Affiliate ID</b> is simply the username that you select when creating your affiliate account.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that when you choose your Affiliate ID, it will be visible in your&nbsp;unique referral URL after the slash at the end of&nbsp;<code>www.clickmagick.com/go/</code>. You can look up your Affiliate ID at any time by logging in to your affiliate account and looking at the&nbsp;top of the page.</div>
