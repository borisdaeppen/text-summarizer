<b>How do I set up a Dynamic Affiliate Link?</b><br />
<br />
Normally when you promote an affiliate offer, when users click your affiliate link they land on whatever page the advertiser wants them to land on.<br />
<br />
This is usually the advertiser&rsquo;s opt-in or sales page, which of course you have no control over.<br />
<br />
But with ClickMagick you can set up what we call a &ldquo;Dynamic Affiliate Link&rdquo; and send the user to any page you want, and still get credit when they make a purchase.<br />
<br />
For example, maybe the advertiser&rsquo;s sales page isn&rsquo;t that great and you want to create your own and then link directly to the advertiser&rsquo;s order form.<br />
<br />
That&rsquo;s the type of thing you can do with a Dynamic Affiliate Link, and it&rsquo;s super easy to do.<br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s all you have to do &hellip;<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>1.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Create a new ClickMagick tracking link and call it whatever you want.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>2.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>For the Primary URL, enter the URL you want the visitor to end up at. In the example above, that would be the URL of the order form for this particular product.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>3.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Click &ldquo;Advanced Settings&rdquo;, then find the Pixel/Code section near the bottom of the settings.<br />
			<br />
			Check the box that says &ldquo;Create Dynamic Affiliate Link&rdquo;, enter your affiliate link in the new field that appears, then just click the &ldquo;Add Code&rdquo; button which will generate and add your custom code to the Pixel/Code box.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>4.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Save your new link, and that&rsquo;s really all there is to it!</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<br />
What this will do is load your actual affiliate link &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; so the user is cookied with your affiliate ID to ensure you get credit when they make a purchase.<br />
<br />
In the example above you would simply have a &ldquo;buy now&rdquo; or other similar button on the sales page you created, and link it to the ClickMagick Dynamic Affiliate Link that you created via the steps above.<br />
<br />
When someone is ready to buy and they click that button it&rsquo;ll take them directly to the advertiser&rsquo;s order form, but of course you&rsquo;ll still get credit for the sale.<br />
<br />
As long as you follow the steps above to make sure the user is cookied with your affiliate ID, you can pretty much send them to any URL you want and control the entire sales process yourself.<br />

<div class="faq-note"><b>Important:</b>&nbsp;Technically this may be against the &ldquo;terms of service&rdquo; of the affiliate program you&rsquo;re promoting.</div>
<br />
<br />
As long as you&rsquo;re using this feature ethically you shouldn&rsquo;t have a problem, but we&rsquo;re not responsible for anything you do so if you&rsquo;re uncertain you might want to ask the advertiser if they&rsquo;re OK with your doing this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-caution"><b>Caution:</b> This feature has the potential to be abused, for example by &ldquo;cookie stuffing&rdquo;, which is illegal in some countries, including the United States.</div>
<br />
<br />
We don&rsquo;t condone anyone using ClickMagick to scam or rip people off, so don&rsquo;t do anything like this or we&rsquo;ll have no choice but to cancel your account. Thanks!
