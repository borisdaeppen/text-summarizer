<b>How do I view my Organic referring keywords?</b><br />
<br />
To view keywords people used to find your pages in search engines, click the number in the TC column.<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ll see all of your stats including clicks, conversions, EPC and more for each and every keyword.<br />
<br />
Please note that Google rarely provides this type of keyword data any more, but occasionally they do, and you&rsquo;ll also see all of your referring keywords from Bing, Yahoo and other popular search engines too.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You can get all of your Google search keywords from the Google Search Console, which you can also sync with your Google Analytics account if you use GA as well.
