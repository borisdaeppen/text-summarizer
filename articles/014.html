<br />
Your account will expire at the end of your current subscription period and you will not be billed again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-caution"><b>Caution:</b> As soon as your account expires, all of your data will be deleted immediately and cannot be restored by signing up at a later date. If you need to cancel your subscription and intend to use ClickMagick again at a later date, you can download all of your links and link data by using the <a href="/user/action/tools/exporter.cgi" target="_blank"><strong>Data Exporter</strong></a> in the Tools menu. Save this downloaded file in case you need to import the data at a later time.</div>
<br />
<br />
We&rsquo;ve put a lot of thought and energy into making ClickMagick a really great service, so if you could take a moment and let us know <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re thinking about canceling, we would be forever grateful. Your feedback could help us make ClickMagick even better for everyone.<br />
<br />
Thank You!<br />
