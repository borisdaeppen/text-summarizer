<strong>Should I issue a refund for a customer?</strong><br />
<br />
This is a fairly common question from anyone just getting started with ClickMagick support so to answer this question, it&#39;s important to keep in mind that ClickMagick has never refused a refund to anyone for any reason...<br />

With this in mind, that should eliminate any gray area for this question to conclude that you should refund a customer if they&rsquo;re asking for a refund (even if it&rsquo;s from 6+ months ago).
