<strong>Do we do Skype calls with our customers?</strong><br />
<br />
Yes, but very rarely. About the only time we&rsquo;ll offer to jump on a Skype call with a user is after going back and forth with them in a ticket and we decide it will save everyone a bunch of time if we jump on a Skype call.<br />
<br />
If a customer asks about a Skype call, you can say something like the following, which should perhaps be added as a canned reply in the Help Desk?<br />
<br />
<br />
<em><span style="color:#999999;">Due to the very technical nature of the support we provide, we really need everything submitted and documented in a support ticket here in the Help Desk.<br />
<br />
Just let us know what you need help with, providing as many details as possible, and we&rsquo;ll do our best to help.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After taking a look at your issue, if we determine that we&rsquo;ll be better able to help you via a Skype call, we&rsquo;ll reach out to schedule a call with you &ndash;&nbsp;but this is rarely necessary.<br />
<br />
Please just let us know what you need help with, and we&rsquo;ll respond back in about an hour.</span></em>
