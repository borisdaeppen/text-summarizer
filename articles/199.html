<strong>How do I setup MOBE with ClickMagick?</strong><br />
<br />
MOBE sells training products for small businesses which you can sell as an affiliate.<br />
<br />
To track your sales as an affiliate, you&rsquo;ll use Postback URL tracking. You&rsquo;ll pass a unique click ID from ClickMagick to MOBE and their system will pass that back to us when a sale is made, which will attribute the sale to the tracking link in your account.<br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s how to set up tracking with MOBE:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>1.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Set up a tracking link in your ClickMagick account using your affiliate URL from MOBE as the Primary URL, with the <code>[clickid</code>] token added at the end to pass a unique sub-ID to MOBE<br />
			<br />
			For example, if your affiliate URL is this:<br />
			<br />
			<code>https://rookieprofitsystem.com/rps-video/?aff_id=xxxxxx</code><br />
			<br />
			Then the URL you would use as the Primary URL of your tracking link would be:<br />
			<br />
			<code>https://rookieprofitsystem.com/rps-video/?aff_id=xxxxxx<strong>&amp;ho_sub=[clickid]</strong></code><br />
			<br />
			MOBE uses&nbsp;<code>ho_sub</code>&nbsp;as a query string variable to let you send data to it.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>2.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>In your MOBE dashboard, you&rsquo;ll need to add a Postback URL. That URL would be:<br />
			<br />
			<code>http://www.clkmg.com/api/s/post/?uid=$userid&amp;s1={ho_sub}&amp;amt={payout}&amp;ref=</code><br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<br />
Your MOBE sales will now show up in your ClickMagick account.
