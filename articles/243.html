<strong>What&rsquo;s the difference between ClickMagick and FunnelMagick?</strong><br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s a way to think about the difference between ClickMagick and FunnelMagick&hellip;<br />
<br />
Let&rsquo;s suppose we&rsquo;re talking about 3 cities: France, London, and New York.<br />
<br />
If I know that you took a plane from France to London in the morning, and another plane from London to New York in the afternoon, then I know that you&rsquo;ve been to France, London, and New York, and in what order. I know that from your flight information, your LINKS.<br />
<br />
With FunnelMagick it looks like this: &nbsp;I have a photo of you at 8am at the Eiffel Tower, another photo of you at Big Ben at 2pm, and a 3rd photo of you at Times Square at 9pm. Again, I know that you been to France, London, and New York and in what order. I have no idea how you got to those places (ie, NO LINKS), but I don&rsquo;t care.<br />
<br />
The funnel tracking code records what time and what place (page). You can build a map just with that information.
