<b>How do I track different traffic sources to a funnel?</b><br />
<br />
If you want to track the results of different traffic sources to your funnel using tracking links, there are two ways you can do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1</b><br />
<br />
If you have just a few traffic sources you want to track, one thing you can do is just create an entirely separate set of links to use for the additional traffic sources.<br />
<br />
This isn&rsquo;t practical if you have more than 2 or 3 traffic sources you want to track, but if that&rsquo;s all you need then you can easily <b>clone the entire link group</b>&mdash;all the links for your entire funnel&mdash;in one click by navigating into the link group for your funnel and then clicking the clone icon in the lower right-hand corner of the links table.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/clonegroup.jpg" /><br />
<br />
Once you clone the entire link group you can then go in and edit the link names, etc. in the new link group/funnel as necessary and you&rsquo;re done.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2</b><br />
<br />
The other, more &ldquo;elegant&rdquo; solution is to use a sub-group.<br />
<br />
To use this method, simply create a new sub-group for each traffic source you want to track within the link group that contains all the links for your funnel.<br />
<br />
For example, you might create one sub-group called &ldquo;Solo Ads&rdquo; where you put all the entry links for your incoming solo ad traffic, and another sub-group called &ldquo;Facebook&rdquo; for all the entry links for your various Facebook ads.<br />
<br />
<b>The key to using this method</b> is that any time you create a new tracking link in a sub-group, you need to make sure that its Primary URL is set to the URL of the Entry Link in the main link group that contains your funnel.<br />
<br />
We&rsquo;ve made this super easy to set up.<br />
<br />
Just go into the sub-group, hover over Create New Link, and then select the <b>Clone Entry Link</b> option.<br />
<br />
The new entry link will&nbsp;automatically be created with the correct Primary URL. All you need to do is update the name or other settings. Just don&rsquo;t change the Primary URL in any way.<br />
<br />
When you use the new entry link, visitors will be redirected to the primary Entry Link of your funnel and ClickMagick will automatically attribute conversions not only to your main funnel links, but also to your new &ldquo;referring&rdquo; entry&nbsp;link in the sub-group.<br />
<br />
This setup allows you to easily track as many different traffic sources to your funnel as you want.<br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s a video walkthrough on how to set this all up:<br />
