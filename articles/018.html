<b>What else do I need to know about MagickBars?</b><br />
<br />
MagickBars, and their available settings, are pretty self-explanatory, except for one &hellip;<br />
<br />
If you let users close a MagickBar, there are two more options you need to set: Spacer and Button Color.<br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s how these come into play &hellip;<br />
<br />
Normally whatever content you add to a MagickBar is automatically centered in the bar, and on the page.<br />
<br />
When you allow the bar to be closed, a close button is added to the right edge of your MagickBar.<br />
<br />
&hellip; this pushes the MagickBar content to the left, which means it&rsquo;s no longer perfectly centered.<br />
<br />
If you want your MagickBar content to remain perfectly centered, turn the Spacer on, and this will add a blank &ldquo;spacer&rdquo; the same width as the close button to the left side of the bar, centering your content again.<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ll generally want to use the spacer, unless you&rsquo;re trying to squeeze every bit of space out of the bar &hellip;<br />
<br />
Button Color should be pretty obvious&mdash;it&rsquo;s the background color of the close button if applicable.<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ll generally want to use the same color as the background of your bar content, so it all blends together, but you can use any color you want.
