<b>What if I want to upgrade/downgrade my plan?</b><br />
<br />
Changing your plan is really simple. First, go to the <strong><a href="/user/billing.cgi" target="_blank">Billing Page</a></strong>&nbsp;by clicking on the&nbsp;<strong>Account</strong> menu&nbsp;at the top of any page. From there, just click on &ldquo;Manage Subscription&rdquo; and you can upgrade or downgrade your plan, as well as change your billing information.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
As a reminder, if you&rsquo;re nearing the monthly click limit of your plan, ClickMagick will automatically send you an email alerting you to that, and if&nbsp;you go over the click limit, ClickMagick will automatically upgrade you so that you don&rsquo;t miss any traffic and lose potential sales.<br />
<br />
We do give you a 10% &ldquo;cushion&rdquo; though &hellip;<br />
<br />
So for example, if you&rsquo;re on the Starter plan with 10,000 clicks a month you really get up to 11,000 clicks before the system will upgrade you to the Standard plan.<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;ve been upgraded automatically, you will remain at that new plan level unless you manually downgrade your plan which you can do from your <strong><a href="/user/billing.cgi" target="_blank">Billing Page</a></strong>&nbsp;&hellip;<br />
<br />
So if you like ClickMagick and plan on using it awhile, consider switching to a yearly plan to take advantage of the yearly discount and save money.<br />
