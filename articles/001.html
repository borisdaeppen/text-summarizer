<b>What are all the different columns in my link stats?</b><br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>TC</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Total number of clicks your link has received.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><strong>UC</strong></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Unique clicks your link has received. If the same person clicks your link 5 times that would generate 5 total clicks, but only 1 unique click.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>FC</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Flagged Clicks are &ldquo;bot&rdquo; or otherwise suspicious clicks that have been separated from and not included in your primary stats, in order to keep your conversion rates and other stats as accurate as possible. To learn more about flagged clicks, and how to control which potentially &ldquo;bad&rdquo; clicks are flagged or blocked, see <strong><a href="/user/faqs.cgi?answer=175">What&rsquo;s the difference between click flagging and blocking?</a></strong><br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><strong>A</strong></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Actions. This can be whatever type of non-sale conversion you want to track such as opt-ins or leads. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you set up conversion tracking and get at least 1 conversion.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>ACR</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Action Conversion Rate. This is the number of unique actions divided by unique clicks, expressed as a percentage i.e. 36.8%. <em>See note below for more information.</em><br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>E</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Engagements. Can be used to track anything you want such as a webinar registration or even just a click on a link. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you set up engagement tracking and get at least 1 engagement.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>ECR</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Engagement Conversion Rate. This is the number of unique engagements divided by the number of unique clicks. <em>See note below for more information.</em><br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>S</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Sales. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you&rsquo;ve set up conversion tracking and get at least 1 sale. Keep in mind that the totals sales are based on unique visitors. This means, for example, that if one visitor generates 2 sales (perhaps from an upsell), that will show 1 uniqu sale in your stats, but with the total sales amount increasing with each upsell. In other words, if a visitor buys a $97 product and a $47 upsell, your stats will show one unique sale of $144. This is the standard method for tracking sales, but it may differ from how your affiliate network or some other service counts sales.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>SCR</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Sales Conversion Rate. This is simply the number of unique sales divided by your unique clicks, expressed as a percentage, e.g. 3.2%. <em>See note below for more information.</em><br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>CPC</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Cost per Click. This is how much you&rsquo;re paying for your traffic, expressed in terms of Cost Per Click. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you&rsquo;ve entered cost data for your link in the Advanced Settings section.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>CPA</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Cost per Action. This is how much you&rsquo;ve paid for each Action. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you are tracking actions and you&rsquo;ve entered cost data.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>CPS</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Cost per Sale. This is how much you&rsquo;ve paid for each sale. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you are tracking sales and you&rsquo;ve entered cost data.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>EPC</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Earnings per Click. This is pretty much the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; for measuring the profitability of an offer. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you are tracking conversions AND you enter cost data. Keep in mind the EPC value is computed using the the number of UNIQUE clicks, not total clicks. You should think of this value as the &ldquo;earnings per unique visitor.&rdquo;<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>ROI</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Return on Investment. This is your revenue minus traffic costs, divided by traffic cost. Again you&rsquo;ll only see something here if you are tracking conversions with a revenue component AND you enter traffic cost.</td>
		</tr>

After you&rsquo;ve made some sales, other stats will become available by hovering over the &ldquo;information&rdquo; icon as shown in this image:<br />
<br />
<img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/faq1otherstats.jpg" /><br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ll see your total traffic cost, total revenue, net profit, average order, and average customer value (also known as average LTV or lifetime value).<br />

<strong>Rotators have a few more columns &hellip;</strong><br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>BC</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>This is the number of clicks that have been routed to your rotator&rsquo;s Backup URL.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>MC</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>This is the number of clicks that have been routed to your rotator&rsquo;s Mobile URL.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> Because conversion rates are so important, when calculating your ACR, ECR and SCR the system does a few extra checks to make these as accurate as possible.<br />
<br />
The main thing is that these ratios are calculated based on UNIQUE actions and unique sales, so the conversion rates shown are not always simply the number in the A, E or S column divided by the number in the UC column.<br />
<br />
For example, you might have 100 unique clicks and 30 opt-ins shown in the A column &hellip;<br />
<br />
But if the system detects 1 of the opt-ins is a duplicate (because the user deleted their cookies or you were testing your own links, etc.) it will use 29 opt-ins when calculating your ACR and it&rsquo;ll show 29% instead of 30%.<br />
<br />
The reason we show the total number of opt-ins in the A column, even if there are a few duplicates, is to more closely match up with the stats from other services you might be using, such as an&nbsp;autoresponder service, etc.</div>
