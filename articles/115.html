<b>What happens if I archive a link or rotator URL?</b><br />
<br />
When you archive a tracking link, ClickMagick simply moves the link to a special link group called &ldquo;Archive.&rdquo;<br />
<br />

<br />
Generally speaking, you&rsquo;ll want to archive tracking links and rotator URLs when you&rsquo;re no longer needing them. Archived links are moved to a special link group named <strong>Archive</strong> so they are kept out of sight, but are always available for future reference.<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, you <em>delete</em> a tracking link or rotator URL, the data is gone for good &hellip;<br />
<br />
To view your archived tracking links, simply select the <strong>Archived Links</strong> group from the <strong>Group Menu</strong> near the top of every tracking link page.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you want to &ldquo;unarchive&rdquo; a tracking link, simply click on the link to edit its settings, and change the <strong>Link Group </strong>to something else.<br />
<br />
To view archived rototar URLs, simply select <strong>Archived URLs</strong> from the <strong>Show</strong> menu when you&rsquo;re viewing the URLs for a rotator.<br />
<br />
You can unarchive a rotator URL by changing its <strong>Status</strong> back to <strong>Active</strong> or <strong>Paused</strong>.<br />

<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> Technically speaking, archiving a rotator URL is the same as pausing it. Once a rotator URL is archived it can no longer receive any traffic.</div>
