<br />
Welcome to ClickMagick!<br />
<br />
To get started with ClickMagick, the first thing you&rsquo;ll want to do is set up your FourPercent&nbsp;Challenge Funnel.<br />
<br />
Vick and his team designed this funnel with your success in mind and they&nbsp;asked us to do them a special favor&hellip; They asked us to create a <strong><em>1-Click Instant Funnel Setup</em></strong> for FourPercent&nbsp;users so that you could get your funnel set up and ready to promote with&nbsp;just one click. You can read the written walkthrough below, your you can watch the set up video here:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><a href="/misc/video.cgi?name=challengefunnel" id="video-link-new"><img border="0" height="24" src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/play.png" width="24" /></a></td>
			<td><img height="1" src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/spacer.gif" width="10" /></td>
			<td><b><a href="/misc/video.cgi?name=challengefunnel" id="video-link-new">Set Up Your FourPercent Challenge Funnel</a></b></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<br />
To get started, you&rsquo;ll need to have your FourPercent&nbsp;Challenge Funnel Setup page open in a browser tab with the ClickMagick settings showing. It should look like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://fourpercent.com/the-challenge-funnel/" target="_blank"><img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/faq2474prefid.jpg" /></a><br />
<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you don&rsquo;t already this page open in another browser window, you can open it now by <strong><a href="https://fourpercent.com/the-challenge-funnel/" target="_blank">CLICKING HERE</a></strong>. Be sure to click on the ClickMagick Setup tab to display your <strong>FourPercent</strong><strong>&nbsp;Ref ID</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-tip"><b>Tip:</b> If you have any trouble getting to the FourPercent&nbsp;Setup page, it&rsquo;s probably because you aren&rsquo;t logged into your FourPercent account. Simply log into your account in a new browser window and <strong><a href="https://fourpercent.com/the-challenge-funnel/" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a></strong> to try again.</div>
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now that you have that page open in another browser window, you&rsquo;re ready to set up your Challenge Funnel in ClickMagick.<br />
<br />
Just click the button below to instantly set up your funnel. You will be asked for your <strong>ClickBank username</strong> and for your <strong>FourPercent</strong><strong> Ref ID</strong>&nbsp;which you can get from your FourPercent Setup page. Once your funnel has been created, you will be given a Funnel ID number which you should write down. Click this button now to set up your funnel:<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://www.clickmagick.com/user/fourpercent/" target="_blank"><img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/faq2474pfunnelbtn.jpg" /></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The final step is to copy your Funnel ID number to the ClickMagick Tracking Setup page. You should still have that open in another browser window. (<strong><a href="https://fourpercent.com/the-challenge-funnel/" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a></strong> to reopen the page if necessary.) Enter your Funnel ID in the FourPercent Setup page and click <strong>Save Changes</strong>:<br />

&nbsp;<br />
That&rsquo;s it! Your FourPercent Challenge Funnel is all set up and ready to use!<br />
