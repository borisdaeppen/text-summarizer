<strong>What is the Monday call about?</strong><br />
<br />
Every Monday we have a CSO Team Call at 12:00 PM EST in the <strong>#helpdesk</strong> channel on Slack.<br />
<br />
These calls will typically last about an hour (sometimes going over a bit) and is a way for us to connect and share about our week.<br />
<br />
Be prepared to answer two important questions, which are:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>1.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>What recurring issues did you face during the week? If you&rsquo;ve seen a pattern of tickets relating to the same issue please bring this up on the call. Many times we can eliminate these issues with an FAQ or video or perhaps even implementing new features.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>2.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>What feature, if any, can you think of that would make ClickMagick even MORE awesome? It could be an admin feature to help you do your job better or a feature you feel would benefit the entire ClickMagick community. Ideas are always welcome!</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<br />
Once everyone on the call speaks about their week we then have open discussion to talk about pretty much anything business related or fun.<br />
<br />
To join this call, just be in the <strong>#helpdesk</strong> channel at 12:00 PM EST where we&rsquo;ll post the option to join this call at that time.
