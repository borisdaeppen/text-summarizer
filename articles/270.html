<strong>What do I do if I can&#39;t work my upcoming shift?</strong><br />
<br />
We understand things happen that will prevent you from being able to work a scheduled shift sometimes. This isn&#39;t a problem, but please try to help...<br />
<br />
Please remember we all work together as a team to hit our target of having an average response time under an hour. So, missing a shift really impacts our times but more importantly, your co-workers who are working diligently to keep our promise to our customers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you&#39;re unable to work your upcoming shift, remember that you are still responsible for the shift so, try to seek out a way to get that shift covered. The support team schedule is set up in a way that provides single-person coverage over all days and times. Missing a shift with the intent of making it up elsewhere by working a different day or time is not an option unless you can work something out with another team member.<br />
<br />
If you know ahead of time that you&#39;ll need specific days off, try reaching out to team members individually to see if you can work something out with one of them such as switching shifts (you work their shift in exchange for them working your shift).<br />
<br />
If you&#39;re able to work it out, be sure to inform Troy so he can update the calendar.<br />
<br />
If this isn&#39;t an option, then your next step would be to contact Troy who will help you figure out a solution.
