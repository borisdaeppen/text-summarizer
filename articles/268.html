<strong>What does &ldquo;deprecated&rdquo; mean?</strong><br />
<br />
In computer software, the word &ldquo;deprecated&rdquo; means that a feature is no longer officially supported and is likely to be removed in the future. In other words, if you discover that you&rsquo;re using a deprecated feature, you should stop using it as soon as possible and use the suggested replacement instead.<br />
<br />
Basically, marking something as &ldquo;deprecated&rdquo; is rather like marking it as &ldquo;obsolete&rdquo;, &ldquo;discontinued&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unsupported&rdquo;.
