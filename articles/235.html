<strong>How do I change or reset my password?</strong><br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;re already logged in to your account and you simply want to change your password, you can do that from your <strong><a href="/user/profile.cgi" target="_blank">User Profile</a></strong> which you can find in the <strong>Account</strong> menu at the top of any page.<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;ve lost your password or need to reset it, simply go to ClickMagick&rsquo;s <strong><a href="/login.cgi" target="_blank">Login</a></strong> page and look for the section that says &ldquo;Forgot your password?&rdquo;:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/faq297forgotpw.jpg" /><br />
<br />
Enter your username or email address and a reset link will be mailed to you at the email address in your account. If you enter an email address, it must match the email associated with your account.<br />
<br />
If the email in your account is no longer valid and you can&rsquo;t retrieve a password reset link to it, contact us at our <strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support</a></strong> desk and we&rsquo;ll take it from there.
