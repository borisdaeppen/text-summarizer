<b>What is the Randomize setting for?</b><br />
<br />
This Advanced Setting applies to Spillover rotators only, and it does two things &ndash; it allows you to distribute clicks relatively evenly to the URLs in your rotator, while at the same time maximizing the value of each and every click.<br />
<br />
Basically what this does is randomly change the order of the URLs in your rotator, at the interval that you specify.<br />
<br />
So if you enter 60 minutes, a new active URL will be moved into the top position every hour.<br />
<br />
You won&rsquo;t want to use this if your spillover rotator is set up and used in a way that allows you to fulfill individual solo ad orders as quickly as possible, in the order you&rsquo;ve arranged them in the rotator &hellip;<br />
<br />
But in most other setups it&rsquo;s the ideal way to send a relatively even number of clicks to each URL in your rotator over any specific period of time.<br />
<br />
Also, all tracking systems (including ClickMagick) rely on cookies to some degree to help keep track of various things &ndash; which means if a user has cookies disabled they may not always be tracked properly.<br />
<br />
This isn&rsquo;t a huge problem because you can barely surf the web these days with cookies turned off &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; but this feature also helps to maximize the value of your clicks in the event that any of your users have cookies disabled, because it helps ensure they&rsquo;ll see a different URL each time they hit your rotator regardless if they have cookies enabled or not.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> The &ldquo;Ignore Last URL&rdquo; option does just what you&rsquo;d expect&mdash;it causes the system to ignore the last URL in the rotator when randomizing, allowing you to use the randomize feature while at the same time ensuring that your last URL doesn&rsquo;t get changed.<br />
<br />
Many users set the &ldquo;On Finish&rdquo; setting of spillover rotators to &ldquo;Last URL&rdquo; and then make the last URL of their rotators a link to another rotator or sales funnel to catch all the &ldquo;overflow&rdquo; traffic, and allows you to continue doing that without the system trying to change the last URL.</div>

<div class="faq-caution"><b>Caution:</b> Do not confuse this Advanced Randomize setting of your spillover rotators with the Random Rotator <em>Mode</em> that you set when creating a rotator.</div>
