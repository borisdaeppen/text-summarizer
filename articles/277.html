<strong>What should I do in the first hour of my shift?</strong><br />
<br />
When starting your shift, enough time has elapsed for tickets to pile into the help desk along with new pending tickets that may require your attention. You&rsquo;ll also be responsible for completing a URL Checking session. To get yourself up to a normal pace where you&rsquo;re only answering new tickets that have come in within the past 30 minutes you&rsquo;ll follow just a few steps.<br />

			<td><strong>Complete a URL Checking session</strong><br />
			<br />
			This is a process we have in place to manually check URLs being entered into our system by new users still in their 14 day free trial period. This process helps us eliminate any bad URLs on our platform and should only take five to ten minutes.<br />
			<br />
			This FAQ will cover more on URL Checking:<br />

			<td><strong>Review pending tickets</strong><br />
			<br />
			This portion of your shift can take anywhere from five minutes to thirty minutes. You&rsquo;ll first sort your view of tickets to &ldquo;All Pending Tickets&rdquo; in ascending order<br />
			<br />
			Review the pending tickets to see if there is anything you may be able to do to help.<br />
			<br />
			A ticket will be marked pending for two reasons.<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Reason #1:</strong> Awaiting our tech team for further development.<br />
			<br />
			If this is the case, the team will be notified when the issue is resolved. Normally, a more seasoned CSO will respond to the ticket with the final resolution.<br />
			<br />
			<strong>Reason #2:</strong> Awaiting help from another CSO<br />
			<br />
			These are the types of pending tickets that will require more of your attention.<br />
			<br />
			As a CSO, there will be times when you come across a ticket that you may not know how to answer. Our normal protocol for this would be for you to tag your fellow CSOs with any input you can provide along with asking for help.<br />
			<br />
			If you see that one of your fellow CSOs is in need of help on answering a ticket and you are confident you can pitch in, then do it!<br />
			<br />
			You can help out by either answering the ticket or, if you don&rsquo;t have an answer but perhaps some input that may be helpful in finding an answer, adding a note while tagging your core team of CSOs.<br />

			If you see a refund ticket or perhaps a ticket where the customer is just saying &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for a response from a previous CSO you should be able to handle these tickets quickly.<br />
