<strong>What does &ldquo;Skip URL Verification&rdquo; do?</strong><br />
<br />
Whenever ClickMagick asks you for a URL, it automatically checks the URL to make sure that it points to a valid page and gives you a warning if page looks bad. This is what you want to happen 97% of the time so that you can correct the URL.<br />
<br />
But there are situations where entering a currently bad URL is exactly what you want to do, perhaps because you&rsquo;re getting ready to create the page that it points to, or you know that the website is currently down.<br />
<br />
Whatever the reason, you can override ClickMagick&rsquo;s URL verification check by clicking on &ldquo;Skip URL Verification.&rdquo;
