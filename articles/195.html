<b>What are all the different columns in my FunnelMagick stats?</b><br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><strong>UV</strong></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Unique Visitors your funnel has received. The same person might visit your funnel 5 times, but because it&rsquo;s the same person, the Unique Visitor column would only show 1 UV count for that person.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>FC</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Flagged Clicks are &ldquo;bot&rdquo; or otherwise suspicious clicks that have made it to your funnel. These clicks are not included in your primary stats in order to keep your conversion rates and other stats as accurate as possible.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><strong>A</strong></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Actions. This can be whatever type of non-sale Page Goal you want to track such as opt-ins or leads. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you&rsquo;ve set up an Action Goal for a page get at least 1 unique visit to the page.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>ACR</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Actions Conversion Rate. This is the number of unique Actions divided by Unique Visitors, expressed as a percentage i.e. 27.4%. <em>See note below for more information.</em><br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>E</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Engagements. Engagements are exactly like Action &ldquo;A&rdquo; Goals except they are reported in a different column in your stats. Engagements are typically a second action that indicates further engagement, after the initial Action. For example, a visitor might opt-in and that&rsquo;s an Action, and then maybe they add something to their shopping cart and that would be an Engagement. You&rsquo;ll only see something in the &ldquo;E&rdquo; column if you&rsquo;ve set up an Engagement Goal for a page and get at least 1 unique visit to the page.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>ECR</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Engagement Conversion Rate. This is the number of unique Engagements divided by the number of Unique Visitors. <em>See note below for more information.</em><br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>S</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Sales. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you&rsquo;ve set up Sales Goal for a page and get at least 1 unique visit to the page. You would typically set a Sales Goal on a Thank You page, indicating that a sale successfully processed.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>SCR</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Sales Conversion Rate. This is simply the number of unique sales divided by your unique visitors, expressed as a percentage, e.g. 4.1%. <em>See note below for more information.</em><br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>CPC</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Cost per Click. This is how much you&rsquo;re paying for your traffic, expressed in terms of Cost Per Click. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you&rsquo;ve entered cost data for an Entry Link to the funnel.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>CPA</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Cost per Action. This is how much you&rsquo;ve paid for each Action. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you are tracking actions and you&rsquo;ve entered cost data for an Entry to the funnel.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>CPS</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Cost per Sale. This is how much you&rsquo;ve paid for each sale. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you are tracking sales and you&rsquo;ve entered cost data an Entry link to the funnel.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>EPC</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Earnings per Click. This is pretty much the &ldquo;gold standard&rdquo; for measuring the profitability of an offer. You&rsquo;ll only see something here if you are tracking sales and you enter cost data for an Entry Link. Keep in mind that this value is the &ldquo;earnings per unique visitor&rdquo; to your funnel.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>ROI</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Return on Investment. This is your revenue minus traffic costs, divided by traffic cost. Again you&rsquo;ll only see something here if you are tracking conversions with a revenue component AND you enter traffic cost.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

After you&rsquo;ve made some sales, other stats will become available by hovering over the &ldquo;information&rdquo; icon as shown in this image:<br />
<br />
<img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/faq257infostats.jpg" /><br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ll see your total ad spend, total revenue, net profit, average order, and average customer value (also known as average LTV or lifetime value).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> Because conversion rates are so important, when calculating your ACR, ECR and SCR the system does a few extra checks to make these as accurate as possible.<br />
<br />
The main thing is that these ratios are calculated based on UNIQUE actions and unique sales, so the conversion rates shown are not always simply the number in the A, E or S column divided by the number in the UV column.<br />
<br />
For example, you might have 100 unique visitors and 30 opt-ins shown in the A column &hellip;<br />
<br />
But if the system detects 1 of the opt-ins is a duplicate (because the user deleted their cookies or you were testing your own links, etc.) it will use 29 opt-ins when calculating your ACR and it&rsquo;ll show 29% instead of 30%.<br />
<br />
The reason we show the total number of opt-ins in the A column, even if there are a few duplicates, is to more closely match up with the stats from other services you might be using, such as an&nbsp;autoresponder service, etc.</div>
