<br />
ClickMagick may not be used to promote sites that contain malware, phishing, or unwanted software downloads.<br />
<br />
And in order to protect the &ldquo;reputation&rdquo; of our tracking domains, every URL you enter into the system is checked in real-time against Google&rsquo;s SafeBrowsing list to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t contain any of this bad stuff.<br />
<br />
Please read the following information which explains what each error message means and how to solve the problem.<br />

<b>Advisory Provided by Google</b><br />
<br />
Google works to provide the most accurate and up-to-date phishing, malware, and unwanted software information.<br />
<br />
However, Google cannot guarantee that its information is comprehensive and error-free: some risky sites may not be identified, and some safe sites may be identified in error.<br />
<br />
To learn more, including how to submit a report to Google if you feel one of your URLs is incorrectly listed, please see the <strong><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/safebrowsing_faq.html#whyAdvisory" target="_blank">Google Safe Browsing FAQ</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Resubmitting Your URL to ClickMagick</b><br />
<br />
We&rsquo;ve found Google&rsquo;s SafeBrowsing system to be extremely accurate, so in order to add a blocked URL to ClickMagick you must first fix the problem and then request a de-listing with Google as explained in the <strong><a href="http://code.google.com/apis/safebrowsing/safebrowsing_faq.html#whyAdvisory" target="_blank">Google Safe Browsing FAQ</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Once Google&rsquo;s system indicates your URL no longer contains malware, phishing or unwanted software downloads, you&rsquo;ll be able to add it to ClickMagick.<br />
<br />
While no exceptions can be made to this policy, we invite you to contact our&nbsp;<strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support</a></strong>&nbsp;desk if you have any questions.
