<b>What is the Group Manager used for?</b><br />
<br />
The <a href="/user/groups.cgi" target="_blank"><strong>Group Manager</strong></a> is found in the Tools menu at the top of every page, and this is where you can set up and manage link groups and rotators groups that&rsquo;ll help you better organize and manage all your different links.<br />
<br />
With the Group Manager, you can create groups, delete groups, and rename groups. You can also create sub-groups of existing groups.<br />
<br />
You can use groups however you want &hellip;<br />
<br />
Most people find it helpful to set up a separate group for each type of traffic they want to track, a separate group for different types of promotions, different groups for different sites or projects, and things of that nature.<br />
<br />
Once you&rsquo;ve created one or more link or rotator groups, you can begin to assign tracking links or rotators to specific groups when you create or edit them &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; and then easily view just the links or rotators in specific groups by selecting only that group from the drop down menu at the top of your main stats pages.
