<b>How does the search filter work exactly?</b><br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s just like a little search engine for your links.<br />
<br />
Enter whatever you want and the system will show you only those links where the Link Name, Primary URL or Notes contains the string that you search for.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> If it ever seems like some of your links have disappeared, most likely you haven&rsquo;t cleared a previous search filter (or you&rsquo;re looking in the wrong link group).</div>
</body></html>
