<b>What&rsquo;s the best way to test my Rotator links?</b><br />
<br />
Testing your own rotator links can be tricky at times depending on how you set them up, and the specific settings you use for your rotators.<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;re selling clicks, such as solo ads, it&rsquo;s surprising how often purchasers will give you links that don&rsquo;t actually work! So, before you even add a link to your rotator, it&rsquo;s good practice to open a new browser window and test the link there first.<br />
<br />
Also, some web pages will not display properly if they are masked or cloaked. This means that if you are using a custom rotator domain with ClickMagick, you should make sure that it is not masked or cloaked, or verify that every link you put in your rotator will work properly with a masked or cloaked domain.<br />
<br />
On that same topic, domain registrars that support masking don&rsquo;t always mask their domains properly. You can be confident that their masked domains will work on desktop browsers, but they don&rsquo;t always work on mobile devices as you would expect. If the masked domain does not properly pass on the mobile information, mobile aware websites will not recognize they they are on a mobile device and will display the desktop layout instead.<br />
<br />
If you use ClickMagick to cloak your rotator domain instead of using the domain registrar to mask it, mobile devices will work as you would expect.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is, if you&rsquo;ve tested the rotator links in a browser first, and you have taken precautions about using masked or cloaked rotator domains, then your links should work fine.
