<b>How can I password protect a link?</b><br />
<br />
Just go into the Advanced Settings for any tracking link and you&rsquo;ll find a spot to enter a password.<br />
<br />
If you enter a password for a tracking link, the user will first see a generic &ldquo;login&rdquo; page where they&rsquo;ll need to enter the correct password to continue.<br />
<br />
Simple as that!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-note"><b>Important:</b> If you use password management software or have your browser configured to auto-fill forms, these MAY attempt to auto-fill the password field.</div>
<br />
<br />
This will cause it to look like you have a password on all of your tracking links when you really don&rsquo;t.<br />
<br />
If this happens to you, simply tweak the settings in your password management tool or browser to NOT auto-fill form fields on the <code>clickmagick.com</code> domain.
