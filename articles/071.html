<b>Can I pay you to set up my funnel tracking for me?</b><br />
<br />
Because of the number of unknown variables involved, we aren&rsquo;t in a position to do the actual set up for specific web sites and funnels, but we can certainly walk you through the process for your situtation since you know your system and your set up much better than we do.<br />
<br />
First, we ask that you watch our <strong><a href="/user/tutorials.cgi" target="_blank">Video Tutorials</a></strong> and read through the appropriate <strong><a href="/user/faqs.cgi" target="_blank">FAQs</a></strong> to see if those will help you get fully set up. If after watching the videos and reading the FAQs, you still can get your funnel set up, then please contact us at our <strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support</a></strong> desk&nbsp;we will help you get set up.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s important that you watch the videos and read the FAQs before submitting any tickets to the <strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support</a></strong> desk because you&rsquo;ll need to understand the basic language and concepts in order to both explain to us what you&rsquo;ve tried, and to understand our answers and suggestions.<br />
<br />
You can find the <strong><a href="/user/tutorials.cgi" target="_blank">Video Tutorials</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/user/faqs.cgi" target="_blank">FAQs</a></strong> in the <strong>Help</strong> menu at the top of every page.
