<b>Why does my split test start over when I change a URL?</b><br />
<br />
Changing the pages involved in a live split test before it&rsquo;s finished essentially renders the stats useless &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; so any time you modify your Primary URL or add new variations to a split test, the system will automatically reset your test and start it over.<br />
<br />
This is the same reason you can&rsquo;t change a split test URL.<br />
<br />
Instead, you should finish your current split test and then start a new one to test any additional variations.<br />
<br />
This ensures that your split test stats are as accurate as possible, and it also makes it easy to start a new test any time you&rsquo;re ready by simply removing the losers and adding one or more new variations to test.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Does the split test start over even when I add a new variation to test?</b><br />
<br />
Absolutely!<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s hard to explain without getting into the nitty-gritty of statistics and the ridiculously advanced math involved, but the short answer is that adding a new variation in the middle of a test without restarting it is a really bad idea if you want to accurately determine a winner.<br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s a silly analogy that paints a perfect picture: Suppose you have two people who are blowing up balloons to see who can cause theirs to pop the fastest&hellip; Then mid-contest, a third person asks to join in on the game. Obviously, you&rsquo;d have to ask the other two people to start over for the third person to have an equal shot at winning. If you didn&rsquo;t have everyone start over, the results would be meaningless.<br />
<br />
Similarly, to determine a true split test winner, every URL has to &ldquo;start over&rdquo; whenever the contestants change.
