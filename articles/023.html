<b>How do I add my opt-in form in the editor?</b><br />
<br />
You can add an opt-in form from any autoresponder service to any pop up or MagickBar that you create using the ClickMagick content editor.<br />
<br />
To do so, simply place the cursor wherever you want to insert the form, click the &ldquo;Source&rdquo; button in the upper left-hand corner of the editor to switch to source mode, then paste the opt-in form code into the HTML source:<br />

<br />
Once you&rsquo;re done click the &ldquo;Source&rdquo; button again to switch back to WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) mode, and you&rsquo;ll see your form appear wherever you inserted it.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that depending on which autoresponder service you use and the code they supply, this is one of the few cases where the editor may not be truly 100% &ldquo;what you see is what you get.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
Make sure you use the preview button to check your final layout, as this will always show you exactly how your content will appear to end users.
