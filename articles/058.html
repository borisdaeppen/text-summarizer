<strong>How do I reset the stats of a tracking link or rotator?</strong><br />
<br />
To reset the stats for a tracking link or rotator, simply click the drop-down menu on the far right of the link or rotator you want to reset, then select &ldquo;Reset Stats.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
To reset the stats for an individual rotator URL, simply navigate to the settings screen for the URL you want to reset, then click the &ldquo;Reset URL&rdquo; button.<br />
<br />
BUT WAIT!<br />
<br />
Generally speaking you shouldn&rsquo;t really get in the habit of using the reset function unless you really know what you&rsquo;re doing, because it can lead to some stats &ldquo;discrepancies&rdquo; if you&rsquo;re not careful.<br />
<br />
The main thing to understand is that when you reset something, the system is simply resetting the stats for that link &ndash; but it still remembers who has visited that link when it comes to determining if a click is unique or not.<br />
<br />
An example should help here &hellip;<br />
<br />
Say you buy a lot of solo ads, and you sometimes buy clicks from the same vendor over and over.<br />
<br />
Imagine a vendor sends you 500 clicks, then you reset the link stats so you can track the next buy separately, and then they send you another 500 clicks &hellip;<br />
<br />
What&rsquo;s going to happen is that most likely you&rsquo;re going to get some repeat clicks from the first batch of 500, and the system is going to recognize these as repeat clicks.<br />
<br />
If there are say 20 repeat clicks, the seller is going to claim they sent you 500 additional clicks but ClickMagick is going to report only 480 new and unique clicks.<br />
<br />
This &ldquo;discrepancy&rdquo; can lead to a lot of confusion &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; and since the original batch of clicks are deleted when you reset the link you won&rsquo;t be able to easily see which users/IPs are repeat clicks, or have a way to easily prove to the seller that you received 20 repeat clicks.<br />
<br />
So here&rsquo;s the bottom line &hellip;<br />
<br />
If you just set up a new link and did some testing, by all means go ahead and reset to get rid of your test clicks.<br />
<br />
If your incoming traffic is such that you don&rsquo;t get many repeat clicks, or you&rsquo;re not paying per click and don&rsquo;t care, go ahead and use the reset function if you want.<br />
<br />
But if you&rsquo;re doing anything where knowing the exact number of unique clicks to a link is important &ndash; such as when you buy solo ad clicks for example &ndash; we really recommend you DON&rsquo;T reset your links.<br />
<br />
Instead, in the example above, you&rsquo;ll want to use Sub-IDs to track your individual traffic buys without resetting the link OR you&rsquo;ll want to use the clone function to quickly clone the tracking link for each new traffic buy.
