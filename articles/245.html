<b>Why was my Bing ad disapproved?</b><br />
<br />
Bing and ClickMagick work <em>great</em> together and we have thousands of users who are running ads with Bing right now.<br />
<br />
That simply means that if your Bing ad has been disapproved, it isn&rsquo;t because of ClickMagick.&nbsp;It means that there&rsquo;s something wrong with your ad, so let&rsquo;s figure out exactly where.<br />
<br />
Here are the steps &hellip;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Remove ClickMagick Tracking from your Ad</strong><br />
<br />
The first step is to temporarily remove your ClickMagick tracking link from your ad. This is the first step in isolating why your ad is getting disapproved.<br />
<br />
To unhook ClickMagick, simply open your Bing ad, click on the &ldquo;Ad URL options&rdquo; link, delete the ClickMagick tracking link from the Tracking Template, and Save your changes.<br />
<br />
This will completely remove ClickMagick from the approval process so we can determine whether it&rsquo;s your ad that&rsquo;s being disapproved, or it&rsquo;s something about ClickMagick that&rsquo;s causing your ad to be disapproved.<br />
<br />
Save your ad and wait until the ad is approved or disapproved.<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> If your ad still gets disapproved after unhooking ClickMagick, this confirms that the problem is with the ad itself.</div>
&nbsp;<br />

<br />
<strong>Reviewing Your Ad</strong><br />
<br />
Now that we&rsquo;ve determined that there&rsquo;s a problem with the ad itself, the first thing to check is whether you correctly entered all the settings. The most critical setting is the &ldquo;Final URL&rdquo;. If you don&rsquo;t get the Final URL right, your ad won&rsquo;t be approved. This is why we talk about the Final URL so much in the Bing Set Up Video.<br />
<br />
If you haven&rsquo;t watched that video in a while, you should probably review it:<br />

		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Are You Violating Bing&rsquo;s Policies?</strong><br />
<br />
If you think you&rsquo;ve set the ad up correctly, the next thing to check is whether the ad violates Bing&rsquo;s policies. Obviously if you&rsquo;re promoting anything illegal, your ad won&rsquo;t be approved, but there&rsquo;s a whole list of things that Bing doesn&rsquo;t allow, from gambling products to healthcare products that make dubious claims ...<br />
<br />
You can review Bing&rsquo;s advertising&nbsp;policies here to see if your product or service is prohibited:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="box-sizing: border-box; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; max-width: 100%;">
	<tbody style="box-sizing: border-box;">
		<tr style="box-sizing: border-box;">
			<td style="box-sizing: border-box; width: 20px;"><a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/apex/index/3/en-us/52023" target="_blank"><img height="20" src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqpage.gif" style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; vertical-align: middle;" width="17" /></a></td>
			<td style="box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;</td>
			<td style="box-sizing: border-box;"><b><a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/apex/index/3/en-us/52023" target="_blank">Bing&rsquo;s Policies for Acceptable Ads</a></b></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<br />
If you review Bing&rsquo;s Policies and you discover that your product or service does not meet their guidelines, then there&rsquo;s not much you can do except to promote a different offer or use a different Ad Network that <em>will</em> allow you to promote your offer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Are you Using a Banned Custom Domain?</strong><br />
<br />
If at one point you were promoting a product or service that Bing prohibits and you submitted that ad using a custom domain, Bing might have blacklisted your domain.<br />
<br />
Once your domain is blacklisted, that means no ad will ever be approved that uses that domain.<br />
<br />
If you discover that your custom domain has been blacklisted, you can try to get your custom domain unblacklisted, but it&rsquo;s probably a lot easier to simply go get another custom domain and start fresh.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, domains are inexpensive and they&rsquo;re easy to set up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Scan your Site for Malware</strong><br />
<br />
Another possibility is that Bing has detected malware on the website that your &ldquo;final URL&rdquo; points to. This happens all the time with unprotected WordPress sites.<br />
<br />
Run a malware scan on your website to rule this out.<br />
<br />
If you discover malware, remove it and resubmit your ad.<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;re using a Page Builder like WordPress, search online for plugins and other tools that add extra security to your site. There are dozens of such plugins for WordPress and more are being added all the time. Just do an online search for &ldquo;WordPress Security&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll find all sorts of great information.<br />
<br />

<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> If you&rsquo;ve tried everything listed here and you still can&rsquo;t get your ad approved, you&rsquo;ll need to contact&nbsp;Bing support or the Bing community to see what you can do. Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t have any sway over Bing&rsquo;s approval process...</div>
