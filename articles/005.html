<b>How do the Geotargeting and Backup URLs work?</b><br />
<br />
Many times an offer you want to promote only accepts traffic from certain countries &ndash; and any other traffic you send through your referral link is just wasted.<br />
<br />
Or maybe you&rsquo;ve just figured out that a particular offer converts best for users in certain countries and you&rsquo;d rather send users in other countries to a different offer rather than just &ldquo;wasting&rdquo; that traffic.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps you sell solo ads and your clients only want clicks from certain countries &hellip;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;Geotargeting&rdquo; is the solution in all these scenarios.<br />
<br />
Just open the link or rotator name you want to set up geotargeting for and click &ldquo;Advanced Settings&rdquo;:<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Next,&nbsp;scroll down to the &ldquo;Geotargeting&rdquo; options:<br />
<br />
<br />
<img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/faq6geotarget.jpg" /><br />
<br />
<br />
Here you have two choices: You can specify only the countries you want clicks from, or only the countries that you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> want clicks from (often called &ldquo;geoblocking&rdquo;). Any clicks that come in that don&rsquo;t match your settings&nbsp;will automatically be re-routed to your &ldquo;Backup URL.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
This will maximize the value of your traffic by sending each user to the offer most likely to result in a positive outcome&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s an opt-in, a lead or a sale.<br />

<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;If a country you want to geotarget isn&rsquo;t listed, let us know and we can add it in literally 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Only the most popular countries that users target are listed, because no one geotargets Botswana, and a list of 246 countries is just a pain to work with.</div>
