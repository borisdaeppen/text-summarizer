<strong>How long does it take for Funnel stats to show up?</strong><br />
<br />
Funnel stats can take up to 60 seconds to show up in your dashboard. If you&rsquo;re expecting to see clicks in your stats, but they haven&rsquo;t shown up after waiting more than a full minute, then you&rsquo;ll need to check a few things.<br />
<br />
The first thing to ask yourself is whether this is the first time through your funnel, or if you&rsquo;ve been through the funnel before.<br />
<br />
The UV column only shows unique visitors so it won&rsquo;t go up if you&rsquo;ve been through the funnel before, even if you were only testing it. The same is true for any Goals that you&rsquo;ve already recorded&mdash;they will only record once per unique visitor.<br />
<br />
You can click on the numbers in the UV, A, E, and S columns to see a list of <em>all</em> the clicks to the funnel. The UV column in that list will show you which clicks are unique visitors and which aren&rsquo;t.<br />
<br />
Here are some other things to check if your stats aren&rsquo;t showing up:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>1.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Does your date-range setting include today&rsquo;s date?<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>2.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Have you included the funnel tracking code in your pages?<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>3.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Did you enter the funnel through the Entry Page? If you first entered your funnel through any page other than your Entry Page, your clicks will be included in your organic stats, not the stats you&rsquo;re probably expecting to see them in ...</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
