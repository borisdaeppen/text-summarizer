<b>Can I send traffic directly to a rotator link?</b><br />
<br />
Absolutely&mdash;as long as you&rsquo;re using a Spillover rotator.<br />
<br />
Just find the URL in your rotator, click the name of the URL, and then scroll down a bit and you&rsquo;ll see the &ldquo;Direct Link&rdquo; URL to use if you want to send to that URL directly.<br />
<br />
By default all clicks, including any repeat clicks from the same visitor, will all be sent to the direct URL &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; but you can override this by adding the letter &ldquo;S&rdquo; to the end of the direct link URL after the numbers, causing any repeat clicks to spillover to the next eligible URL instead.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> If a click can&rsquo;t be delivered to this URL based on one or more of your settings&mdash;for example, Max Clicks has been reached&mdash;then the click will simply be delivered to the next eligible URL or the Backup URL as usual.</div>
