<strong>Do you have Training Videos?</strong><br />
<br />
We sure do! We have an entire library of training videos.<br />
<br />
You can find all of our training videos by looking in the <a href="/user/tutorials.cgi" target="_blank"><strong>Video Tutorials</strong></a> section of the <strong>Help</strong> menu.<br />
<br />
You can also find video links on many of&nbsp;ClickMagick&rsquo;s pages. Just look in the upper left-hand corner of the page to see if there&rsquo;s a Help video for that specific page. The video link will normally look&nbsp;like this:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td><img border="0" height="16" src="https://cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/plays.png" width="16" />&nbsp;<span style="color:#2c3e50;">Help</span></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<br />
Most of our videos have a clickable Table Of Contents that you can reference at any time while the video is playing,&nbsp;so if you want to skip to a particular section of the video simply select the chapter you want to watch.<br />
<br />
You can also watch our videos at double speed and get all the information in half the time!<br />
<br />
Finally, if you can&rsquo;t find a video on the topic that you&rsquo;re interested in, feel free to <strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">submit a ticket</a></strong> to our <a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank"><strong>1-Hour Support Desk</strong></a> and make a request for it. While we can&rsquo; t shoot videos on demand, we can certainly add them to our project list for future possibilities.
