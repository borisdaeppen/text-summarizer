<strong>Why does it say my funnel is &ldquo;incomplete&rdquo;?</strong><br />
<br />
In order to track traffic to your funnel, the funnel set up must be &ldquo;complete&rdquo; on the funnel builder canvas.<br />
<br />
A &ldquo;complete&rdquo; funnel consists of at least two pages, with all pages having at least one connection to another page, and each page must have a valid name and URL.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> Traffic will NOT be tracked for an incomplete funnel as the stats would be meaningless.</div>
