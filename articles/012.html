<b>Why are countdown timers so awesome?</b><br />
<br />
In almost every case, creating a sense of urgency will increase your conversions. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
And by far one of the best ways to create a sense of urgency is by displaying a countdown timer to your visitors.<br />
<br />
This shows your visitors how much time they have left to make up their minds about your offer &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; and forces them to make a decision NOW.<br />
<br />
As with everything else in marketing, using a countdown timer in your funnel should be tested, but we can&rsquo;t recall a situation in which a properly used timer DIDN&rsquo;T increase conversions.<br />
<br />
In fact, one ClickMagick user shared that he increased his conversions by 68% in a recent test &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; and all he did was add a countdown timer.<br />
<br />
When combined with special offers, bonuses, one-time-offers, etc. we&rsquo;ve literally seen increases of 100% or more!
