<b>What are the optional rotator URL settings?</b><br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s an overview of all the optional URL settings &hellip;<br />
<br />
Please note that these settings are analyzed, calculated and/or applied once per minute, NOT on every click. You can add up to 10,000 URLs per rotator.<br />
<br />
<b>Max Clicks</b> &ndash; If specified, this is the max number of unique clicks that a URL can receive. Once it reaches this amount it will be automatically paused.<br />
<br />
<b>Max Daily Clicks</b> &ndash; If specified, this is the max number of unique clicks per day that a URL can get. The number of daily clicks delivered resets to 0 at midnight in the time zone selected in your profile.<br />
<br />
<b>Bonus</b> &ndash; If specified, this is the percentage of Max Clicks to overdeliver. If Max Clicks is set to 100 and Bonus is set to 10%, the system will actually send 110 unique clicks.<br />
<br />
<b>Min T1</b> &ndash; If specified, this is the minimum <strong><a href="/user/faqs.cgi?answer=8">Tier 1 Traffic Ratio</a></strong>&nbsp;that&rsquo;s allowed for this URL. For example, say you sell solo ads and you guarantee your clients at least 80% Tier 1 clicks. Just set this to 80 and the system will ensure they get at least an 80% T1 ratio automatically. &nbsp;*<em>See Note at end</em><br />
<br />
<b>Max T1</b> &ndash; If specified, this is the maximum <strong><a href="/user/faqs.cgi?answer=8">Tier 1 Traffic Ratio</a></strong> that is allowed for this URL. Used together with the Min T1 setting above you can achieve the T1 ratios you want for each link with pinpoint accuracy. &nbsp;*<em>See Note at end</em><br />
<br />
<b>Min Mobile</b> &ndash; If specified, this is the minimum amount of mobile traffic this URL will receive on a percentage basis. So if you want a URL to receive at least 30% mobile traffic, you&rsquo;d just enter 30. If you wanted to receive only mobile clicks, you would enter 100. &nbsp;*<em>See Note at end</em><br />
<br />
<b>Max Mobile</b> &ndash; If specified, this is the maximum amount of mobile traffic this URL will receive on a percentage basis. So if you want a URL to receive no more than 30% mobile traffic, you&rsquo;d just enter 30. If you didn&rsquo;t want to receive any mobile clicks at all, you would enter 0. &nbsp;*<em>See Note at end</em><br />
<br />
<b>Start Date/End Date</b> &ndash; These are just what they sound like. If specified the system will not send any traffic to a URL until the Start Date and time, and it will automatically stop sending traffic once the End Date and time arrives, regardless if Max Clicks has been reached.<br />
<br />
<b>Pop Up/MagickBar</b> &ndash; This allows you to specify a pop up and/or MagickBar on a per-URL basis. The selections you make here will override your rotator setting.<br />
<br />
<b>Weight</b> &ndash; When using a Sequential rotator, this allows you to specify that one URL should get more traffic than the others. If you want it to receive 3X as much traffic as the other URLs, you&rsquo;d select a Weight of 3 for example. This is normally used in conjunction with ad co-ops.<br />
<br />
<b>SmartSwap</b> &ndash; See the <strong><a href="/user/faqs.cgi?answer=37">SmartSwap FAQ</a></strong> for details.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:&nbsp;</b>When delivering clicks, mininum and maximum percentages are maintained on a click-by-click basis.<br />
<br />
For example, if you have a minimum T1 value of 90% and a click comes through, ClickMagick will balance the T1/non-T1 ratio at 90%. This means that even though a click could be sent to the URL, if won&rsquo;t be if it would throw off the ratio.<br />
<br />
Take this real world example: You&rsquo;re delivering 1,000 clicks with a 90% minimum T1. That means the URL could accept up to 100 non-T1 clicks. However, if the first 100 clicks were all non-T1 clicks, ClickMagick would not deliver all 100 to the URL because it would throw the 90% ratio too far off.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;the way solo sellers insisted on having it, so that a new solo wouldn&rsquo;t start off with 100 non-T1 clicks at the beginning of a delivery. The delivery will be balanced.<br />
<br />
