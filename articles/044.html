<b>What are the 4 different types of pop ups?</b><br />
<br />
ClickMagick offers 4 different types of pop ups &hellip;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>&ldquo;On Load&rdquo; Pop Up</b><br />
<br />
This is a standard pop up that appears as soon as the visitor lands on the page.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Delayed Pop Up</b><br />
<br />
This is just like a standard pop up, but it appears after the number of seconds you specify have passed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>&ldquo;Intelligent&rdquo; Exit Pop</b><br />
<br />
With the &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; exit pop up the system uses the users&rsquo; mouse position and movement to try to detect when a user is about to leave your page, and then it fires the exit pop up before they actually leave.<br />
<br />
The upside is that your exit pop up is guaranteed to fire, if for example the user decides they&rsquo;re done surfing the web and they decide to do something else on their computer without closing their browser.<br />
<br />
The downside is that occasionally this type of pop up can be triggered &ldquo;early&rdquo; if the user randomly moves their mouse near the very top of their browser window, although this doesn&rsquo;t happen often and this isn&rsquo;t a very big problem.<br />
<br />
This type of pop up is often also referred to as an &ldquo;exit intent&rdquo; pop up, and it&rsquo;s the most commonly used pop up right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Exit Redirect</b><br />
<br />
This isn&rsquo;t technically a pop up, but it can be used like one. An Exit Redirect simply redirects the user to the URL you&rsquo;ve entered when they attempt to leave the page.<br />
<br />
No alert boxes of any kind are displayed&mdash;your visitors are simply redirected.
