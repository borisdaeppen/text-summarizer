<b>What is ClickMagick&rsquo;s official Anti-Spam policy</b><br />
<br />
We have a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to sending unsolicited emails containing ClickMagick tracking links.<br />
<br />
Of course, we also know that sometimes people forget when they have opted-in to an email list&mdash;or they just like to cry &ldquo;Spam!&rdquo; rather than click the unsubscribe button&mdash;so we&rsquo;ll ALWAYS give you the opportunity to explain any spam complaints that you might get.<br />
<br />
If we receive a spam complaint regarding your account, we&rsquo;ll simply ask you to provide opt-in details for the visitor who is making the complaint. SImply provide the necessary IP, timestamp, opt-in URL, etc. to show that they really did opt-in to your list.<br />
<br />
If you can provide this information, then you&rsquo;re fine and have nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
However, If you can&rsquo;t provide this information,&nbsp;we&rsquo;ll give you exactly ONE warning and hope it doesn&rsquo;t happen again.<br />
<br />
If we receive further complaints, and you can&rsquo;t prove that they opted-in to your list, we&rsquo;ll have no choice but to close your account.
