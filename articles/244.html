<strong>Why doesn&rsquo;t my tracking link work with Bing?</strong><br />
<br />
ClickMagick and Bing work great together so if you&rsquo;re having tracking problems with Bing it simply means that something isn&rsquo;t set up correctly. The most common reason is that you haven&rsquo;t properly set up your tracking link in your ad.<br />
<br />
The easiest way to track down tracking link problems is to open your Bing account in one browser window while watching the set up video side-by-side in another window. Here&rsquo;s a link to the Bing Set Up Video:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><a href="/misc/video.cgi?name=bingsetup" id="video-link-new"><img border="0" height="24" src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/play.png" width="24" /></a></td>

<br />
<br />
If reviewing the video didn&rsquo;t help you find your problem,&nbsp;there are two other settings to check ...<br />
<br />
Either you&rsquo;ve got a&nbsp;<em>campaign-wide</em> tracking template set up&mdash;which won&rsquo;t work with ClickMagick&mdash;or you&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;auto-tagging&rdquo;&nbsp;turned on which is also incompatible with ClickMagick.<br />
<br />
Let&rsquo;s disable both of these settings &hellip;<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Bing&rsquo;s Campaign-Wide Tracking Template</strong><br />
<br />
There are two common models that tracking systems use, the &ldquo;query string&rdquo; model and the &ldquo;Sub-ID&rdquo; model. You don&rsquo;t really need to know what that means other than to understand that ClickMagick uses the &ldquo;Sub-ID&rdquo; model.<br />
<br />
Bing, on the other hand, assumes that you&rsquo;re using the &ldquo;query string&rdquo; model and that makes their campaign-wide tracking template incompatible with any tracking system&mdash;such as ClickMagick&mdash;that uses the &ldquo;Sub-ID&rdquo; model.<br />
<br />
Setting up the tracking template at the <em>ad-level</em> works great for both types of tracking systems.<br />
<br />
So, as long as you stick to using the tracking template associated with each individual ad (as shown in our <strong><a href="/misc/video.cgi?name=bingsetup">Bing Set Up Video</a></strong>), you can track anything you&rsquo;d like in Bing. Just make sure you have the <em>campaign-wide</em> tracking template turned off.<br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s how &hellip;<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>1.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Go into your campaigns by clicking on the <strong>Campaigns</strong> tab at the top of your screen.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>2.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Click on the <strong>Settings</strong> tab, then <strong>click on the name of the campaign</strong> you want to check:<br />
			<br />
			<img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/faq307trackingtmpl.jpg" /><br />
			&nbsp;<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>3.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>Scroll down to the <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> and look for the <strong>Campaign URL options</strong> section near the bottom of the page. Click on the link that says &ldquo;Tracking template&rdquo;. An entry box will pop open. Make sure that box is empty as shown in the screenshot.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>4.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td>If you changed anything, be sure to click on the Save button at the very bottom-left of the page to save your changes.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<br />
That&rsquo;s all you need to do to make sure that you don&rsquo;t have a campaign-wide tracking template set up that conflicts with the tracking template that you set up in your ad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Bing&rsquo;s Auto-Tagging Feature</strong><br />
<br />
Bing&rsquo;s auto-tagging feature also assumes that you&rsquo;re using a &ldquo;query string&rdquo; based tracking system so it can also cause problems if you have it enabled.<br />
<br />
By default, Bing has auto-tagging turned off, so if you didn&rsquo;t change that setting anywhere, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about it. But if nothing else you&rsquo;ve tried seems to have fixed your problem, you should double-check this setting.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps to disable auto-tagging in your account:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>1.</b></td>

If you&rsquo;ve made sure that these settings are correct, and that you&rsquo;ve set up your tracking link correctly as shown in the <strong><a href="/misc/video.cgi?name=bingsetup">Bing Set Up Video</a></strong>, then you should be able to successfully track ads inside of Bing using ClickMagick.<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-tip"><b>Tip:</b> If you&rsquo;ve double-checked all of your settings and you still aren&rsquo;t able to get your ad to track with ClickMagick, contact us at our <strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support</a></strong> desk and send us screenshots of the different settings in your Bing account. In other words, send us a screenshot of your tracking template settings for your individual ad under the &ldquo;Ad URL options&rdquo;, and send a screenshot of each of the settings shown in this FAQ so we can verify that they are correct.<br />
