<b>What are the 4 different rotator modes?</b><br />
<br />
ClickMagick offers four rotator modes to deliver clicks to your rotator URLs in different ways, depending upon what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish. These four methods are described below.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that rotators should not be used for &ldquo;split testing.&rdquo;&nbsp;Split-testing, which is a method to determine which of two (or more) pages creates the most conversions from your visitors, is done using <em>tracking links</em>, not rotators. For an explanation of this critical point, see this FAQ:<br />

<br />
With that understanding, let&rsquo;s cover the four different rotator modes:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Fulfillment Mode</b><br />
<br />
The Fulfillment Mode will send all traffic to the first active URL in the rotator whose&mdash;including repeat clicks from the same user &ndash; until that URL has received the maximum number of unique clicks (plus bonus) specified.<br />
<br />
When we say &ldquo;all traffic,&rdquo;&nbsp;we really mean &ldquo;all traffic that matches the settings for that URL.&rdquo;&nbsp;For example, if the URL has geotarget settings for just <strong><a href="/user/faqs.cgi?answer=8">Tier 1</a></strong> countries, that URL will not receive any clicks from non-Tier 1 countries.<br />
<br />
You would use the Fulfullment Mode when you&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;I want the first order filled, then the second order filled, then the third order filled...&rdquo;, and so on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Spillover Mode</b><br />
<br />
The Spillover Mode&nbsp;will send traffic to each URL in the rotator, one after the other, as repeat users hit your rotator multiple times.<br />
<br />
Each unique visitor starts at the top for Spillover rotators.<br />
<br />
This is mostly used when selling solo ads as it will result in the most unique clicks and maximize your traffic.<br />
<br />
For example the first time a user hits your rotator they&rsquo;ll see URL #1, the next time they&rsquo;ll see URL #2, etc.<br />
<br />
If a user sees ALL the active URLs in a Spillover rotator, the system will send them either to your Backup URL, the Last URL in the rotator, or they will &ldquo;start over&rdquo; at the top of the rotator on any additional clicks, depending on what you specify for the &ldquo;On Finish&rdquo; setting.<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;re using the Backup URL for non-T1 clicks you wouldn&rsquo;t really want active T1 users going there, so one thing you can do is select the &ldquo;Last URL&rdquo; option &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; and just make sure that the last URL in your Spillover rotator is a link to a separate marketing funnel so you can show them something new if they continue clicking.<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ll generally use this mode if you&rsquo;re selling unique clicks or you&rsquo;re interested in maximizing the value of each click by ensuring as few non-unique clicks are sent to each URL in your rotator as possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Random Mode</b><br />
<br />
The Random mode&nbsp;is just what it sounds like, and it will distribute your clicks in a completely random manner to all active URLs.<br />
<br />
Over time this will result in each link receiving roughly the same number of clicks (assuming all the URLs have the same settings), but even or equal distribution cannot be guaranteed with a small number of clicks.<br />
<br />
In the same way that you can flip a coin 20 times and get 15 heads and 5 tails, if you send a small number of clicks to a random rotator one or a few URLs could very well receive most of the clicks.<br />
<br />
This is normal, and such is the nature of randomness.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Sequential Mode</b>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Sequential Mode&nbsp;will send incoming clicks to each rotator URL in order, then when it reaches the bottom it will simply start over again at the top.<br />
<br />
This mode does not try to maximize unique clicks the way a Spillover rotator does, so generally speaking you won&rsquo;t want to use this for solo ads &hellip;<br />
<br />
However, this is the best mode to use for ad co-ops as it ensures all URLs receive the same number of clicks, assuming that all URLs have the same settings.<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-tip"><b>Tip:</b> There is a &ldquo;weight&rdquo; setting you can use to tell the system that certain URLs should receive more traffic than others. You would use this setting, for example, if someone buys two shares in your co-op.</div>
