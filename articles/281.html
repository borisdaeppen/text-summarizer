<strong>How do I use the URL checking system?</strong><br />
<br />
Keeping bad URLs like malware and phishing scams off of our platform is extremely important.&nbsp; To accomplish this, we review all URLs entered into our system by users in their 14 day trial period. This is both a manual process that you&rsquo;ll be handling and an automatic process our system performs for URLs that are already known to be safe.<br />
<br />
The URL Checking System is located on the admin panel and while you are reviewing these URLs, you&rsquo;ll notice the total number of URLs decreasing by several digits instead of just one at a time because the system itself is also working behind the scenes.<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> You&rsquo;ll be performing a URL checking session before starting your shift and before ending your shift which should only take about five to ten minutes at the very most.</div>
<br />
<br />
To check a URL, simply click on the URL presented which will open that page in a new tab. You don&rsquo;t need to spend much time on the page as you&rsquo;ll just take a quick glance at the content to conclude whether or not this is something allowed on ClickMagick.<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;ll have five options to choose from in order to set the status of the page you&rsquo;re viewing which are <strong>Good</strong>, <strong>Skip</strong>, <strong>Monitor</strong>, <strong>Whitelist</strong>, and <strong>Bad</strong>.<br />
<br />
If the URL is acceptable, you&rsquo;ll simply click <strong>Good </strong>and move on to the next URL.<br />
<br />
However, if the page you&rsquo;re viewing is a blank white page or an error page you&rsquo;ll choose to <strong>Skip </strong>this URL.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, you&rsquo;ll land on a page that is either incomplete or perhaps the content is questionable so you want to get a better idea of the user&rsquo;s intentions. In this case, you&rsquo;ll choose&nbsp;to <strong>Monitor&nbsp;</strong>the URL. This will then add the URL to the back of the queue so it will not come up again for at least twenty-four hours for another review.<br />
<br />
<strong>Whitelist </strong>is an option you&rsquo;ll choose for domains like <code>google.com</code> or <code>bing.com</code> (this is usually a user testing). These are domains we know won&rsquo;t contain malware or anything so the next time a URL like this comes into queue, we know we don&rsquo;t have to check it.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if you do come across a scammy site that shouldn&rsquo;t be on our platform, you&rsquo;ll simply enter a reason and choose <strong>Bad</strong>. This will then notify our tech team for further action.<br />
<br />
Again, you&rsquo;re looking for any sites that clearly should not be on ClickMagick&rsquo;s platform such as pages with the PayPal logo where you can &ldquo;claim your funds&rdquo;, fake banking sites with the intention of tricking users into entering their banking information, etc.
