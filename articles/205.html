<strong>How do I delete a rotator, rotator URL, or rotator group?</strong><br />
<br />
If you want to delete a rotator, just click on the Edit menu <img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/pencil.png" /> to the right of any rotator and select&nbsp;<strong>Delete Rotator</strong>&nbsp;from the drop down menu:<br />

To delete a rotator URL, edit the specific URL you want t delete and you&rsquo;ll find a <strong>Delete URL</strong> button at the very bottom of the rotator URL settings:<br />

To delete a rotator group&mdash;which does NOT delete the rotators themselves&mdash;go to the&nbsp;<strong>Tools</strong>&nbsp;menu at the top of every page and select the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.clickmagick.com/user/groups.cgi" target="_blank">Group Manager</a></strong>. From there, choose the&nbsp;<strong>Delete Groups</strong>&nbsp;option. Choose the rotator group you want to delete, then click the&nbsp;<strong>Delete Group</strong>&nbsp;button:<br />

<br />
If you want to delete the group and all of the rotators within it, the easiest way is to first select the group on the&nbsp;<strong>Rotators</strong>&nbsp;page to show only the rotators in the group, then delete each rotator, which will also delete all the rotator URLs associated with that rotator. Finally delete the group itself.
