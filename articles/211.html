<strong>Why can&rsquo;t I change my funnel&rsquo;s Page URL setting?</strong><br />
<br />
If the Page URL setting for your Entry Page is disabled, that means that you have created entry links that still point to the old Page URL setting.<br />
<br />
If you were to change the Page&rsquo;s URL, you would break all of the existing entry links&mdash;at least from a funnel tracking viewpoint&mdash;because those entry&nbsp;links wouldn&rsquo;t point to the new URL that you&rsquo;re wanting to enter right now. Changing your page&rsquo;s URL would also completely invalidate all of your current statistics.<br />
<br />
This is why FunnelMagick won&rsquo;t let you casually change your Page URL.<br />
<br />
If you want to change the URL of your entry page, there are 3 approaches you can take, depending upon&nbsp;what you&rsquo;re trying to accomplish. If you&rsquo;re unsure which approach to use, use the first approach where you simply delete your Entry Links and start fresh.<br />

			<td valign="top"><b>1.</b></td>

			<td>If you know that none of the current entry links are being used anywhere, you can simply go to the Settings menu <img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/gear.png" />&nbsp;of your funnel and select &ldquo;Entry Links&rdquo;:<br />
			<br />
			<br />
			<img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/faq273entrylinks.jpg" /><br />
			<br />
			From there, you can delete your existing entry links. FunnelMagick will then let you edit the Page URL of the entry page for your funnel.<br />
			&nbsp;
			<div class="faq-caution"><b>Caution:</b> Keep in mind that if you&rsquo;ve created any tracking links that point to your original entry links, you&rsquo;ll need to update those tracking links. Once you correct your entry links, those tracking links will no longer be valid.</div>

			<td>If you have active entry links for the funnel, or if you&rsquo;re unsure whether you do, another approach is to clone your existing funnel and make changes there.<br />
			<br />
			Cloning a funnel is more complicated but is often the right approach. Cloning is more complicated because you&rsquo;ll need to add the tracking code for the cloned funnel to the actual web pages of the funnel. Depending upon your situation, this might mean having to duplicate your web pages as well.<br />

With this setup, you keep the existing Page URL, and add another one that you can use to create new entry link URLs. Simply click on the &ldquo;Variation URLs&rdquo; tab in the Page Settings:<br />
