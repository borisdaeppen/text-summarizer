<strong>Why was I charged \$147 when I signed up for the monthly plan?</strong><br />
<br />
It looks like you accidentally signed up for the Yearly Starter Plan. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot from our Pricing page showing the option to choose the Yearly plan, which is selected by default:<br />

<br />
But fret not! It&rsquo;s easy to switch to the monthly plan and get a refund for the remaining charges.<br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s how you can do that:<br />

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>1.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td>In the <strong>Account</strong> menu at the top of the screen, click on <a href="/user/billing.cgi" target="_blank"><strong>Billing</strong></a>.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> If you were recently charged for the Yearly plan, the system will automatically refund you the $130 difference and charge you $17 per month only.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that most banks typically take 2 to 3 business days to process the refund on their end but your bank could be different. You will need to contact your bank to get that information.</div>
