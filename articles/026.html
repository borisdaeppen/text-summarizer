<b>Can I change my ClickMagick username?</b><br />
<br />
You sure can&mdash;just keep in mind that if you change your username, your existing links won&rsquo;t work anymore since they include your username:<br />
<br />
<code>http://www.clkmg.com/$username/...</code><br />
<br />
If you want to change your username just contact our&nbsp;<strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support</a></strong>&nbsp;desk and let us know what you want to change it to. Your username must be 4-20 characters, and as long as the name is available we&rsquo;ll be more than happy to change it for you.<br />
<br />
To speed things up, send us at least two new usernames in case your first choice has already been taken.<br />
<br />
Also, if you&rsquo;re currently running an ad or driving traffic to your existing links in some way, let the traffic die down before changing your username, or you risk losing the traffic directed to your original username.<br />

<div class="faq-tip"><b>Tip:</b> If you were interested in changing the username of your <em>affiliate</em> account&mdash;which is different&mdash;you can do that too. Again, just contact us at the the <strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support</a></strong> desk.</div>

<div class="faq-caution"><b>Caution:&nbsp;</b>If you&rsquo;ve set up a custom domain using the <strong>Script Forwarding</strong> method, you&rsquo;ll need to update the <code>index.php</code> file you uploaded to your server&nbsp;because it contains your old username.<br />
<br />
Once your username has been changed, simply <strong><a href="/user/custom.cgi" target="_blank">Regenerate&nbsp;Your Custom Files</a></strong> and upload the new <code>index.php</code> file, replacing the previous one, and you&rsquo;ll be all set.<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;ve got the technical knowledge, you can also manually edit your existing <code>index.php</code> file using a text editor and simply change the username yourself. Remember to upload the edited file unless you&rsquo;ve edited it directly on your website.<br />
<br />
