<strong>Where do I get my commission information for taxes?</strong><br />
<br />
All &ldquo;payment settlement entities&rdquo;, including PayPal, are required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to provide information to the IRS about vendors and affiliates who receive electronic payments.<br />
<br />
Since we only pay commissions via PayPal, we are not required to provide you with any tax related documents &ndash; such as a 1099-MISC form that you might be curious about &ndash;&nbsp;so you won&rsquo;t receive anything from ClickMagick.<br />
<br />
Instead, you&rsquo;ll receive a 1099-K form from PayPal which details the commissions you&rsquo;ve earned and the exact amount that PayPal will be reporting to the IRS, if applicable.<br />
<br />
The PayPal page below has all the details and answers to common questions. If you have any additional questions, please contact PayPal directly:<br />
