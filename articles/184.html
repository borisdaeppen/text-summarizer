<strong>What are outstanding clicks?</strong><br />
<br />
When it comes to rotators, outstanding clicks are simply the clicks remaining until your rotator order is fulfilled.<br />
<br />
So if you have two URLs in a rotator and one of them&nbsp;has 80 out of 100 clicks, and another 95 out of 100, then the total number of outstanding clicks would be 25, which you would get by adding the 20 plus 5 clicks remaining from both URLs.
