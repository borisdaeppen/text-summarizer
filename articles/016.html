<b>What do you recommend for &ldquo;cookie duration?&rdquo;</b><br />
<br />
Cookie duration determines how much time must pass before any visitor will see your same pop up again, and we generally recommend no less than 60 minutes.<br />
<br />
Anything less and you might annoy some visitors.<br />
<br />
Many believe the &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; on this is 24 hours, in which case you&rsquo;d enter 1440 minutes.<br />
<br />
This means visitors will only see your pops once a day.<br />
<br />
While you can technically set the cookie duration to 0, we REALLY don&rsquo;t recommend that as it WILL irritate your visitors.<br />
<br />
For example, if the visitor&nbsp;moves their mouse around the edges of their browser window for some reason, your exit pop up will keep appearing and re-appearing.
