<strong>Why don&rsquo;t my ClickFunnels pages show any visits?</strong><br />
<br />
This is a pretty common question among ClickFunnels users. Here&rsquo;s why &hellip;<br />
<br />
When you create a new funnel in ClickFunnels, ClickFunnels generates an internal link for the first page of the funnel that&rsquo;s slightly different from the <em>final</em> link to the first page of the funnel.<br />
<br />
Take a look at this screenshot of an Opt-in page that was created in ClickFunnels. Notice the URL that was automatically generated:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/faq350editorpage.jpg" /><br />
<br />
If you were to take that generated URL and enter it into a browser, it would pull up the Opt-in page, but the <em>final</em> URL would typically be different, as in this case:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/faq350finalpage.jpg" /><br />
<br />
<br />
For FunnelMagick to record visits correctly, you need to enter the <em>final</em> URL in the Page URL setting of your FunnelMagick page. If you use the generated URL, no visits will be recorded ...<br />
<br />
Just take the generated URL that ClickFunnels gives you, enter it in a browser, and use the final URL that the browser shows you &hellip;<br />
<br />
By the way, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with how ClickFunnels handles the pages in the funnels, but to track those pages correctly, you need to understand the distinction between the URL they give you and the final URL that your visitors end up on.<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;re using ClickFunnels,&nbsp;the most common reason that your funnel isn&rsquo;t showing any visitors is because you&rsquo;re using the wrong URL in your Page Settings, but there are other reasons for this as well. You can read about those here:<br />
