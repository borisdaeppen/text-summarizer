<b>What if I can&rsquo;t figure out how to use the editor?</b><br />
<br />
When building ClickMagick we had a somewhat tough decision to make &hellip;<br />
<br />
Do we restrict functionality and limit what you can do to make the system easier to use for &ldquo;newbies&rdquo;? Or, do we give users 99.9% control in terms of what they can create, and what kind of content can be used in pop ups and MagickBars?<br />
<br />
We&rsquo;ve been quite successful online ourselves, and whenever we&rsquo;re faced with a question like this we usually ask ourselves what WE would want &hellip;<br />
<br />
&hellip; and in this case having maximum control over as much as possible was the obvious answer.<br />
<br />
Yes, the editor can be a little intimidating at first, but we promise you&rsquo;ll love what you can create after investing just a little time learning how to use it.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you have no experience with content creation at all then you may need to get some help creating custom pop ups and MagickBars.<br />
<br />
If you do, your best bet is to just hire someone to create whatever you need.<br />
<br />
You can find people on sites like <strong><a href="http://www.odesk.com" target="_blank">oDesk</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://www.fiverr.com" target="_blank">Fiverr</a></strong>, and the <strong><a href="http://www.warriorforum.com" target="_blank">Warrior Forum</a></strong> who will create pop ups and layout content for you, for literally a few bucks.<br />
<br />
You&rsquo;d just say something like &ldquo;I need a 500 by 300 pixel layout with this image in the upper left-corner, this text over here, and this opt-in form below it&rdquo; &hellip;<br />
<br />
And they can whip it up for you quickly and easily.<br />
<br />
Then you&rsquo;d just paste the &ldquo;code&rdquo; they create right into our WYSIWYG editor (in &ldquo;source&rdquo; mode) &ndash; and voila, it&rsquo;s all set up!
