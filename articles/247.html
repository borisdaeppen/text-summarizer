<strong>How can I verify who my affiliate referrer is?</strong><br />
<br />
The person who referred you to ClickMagick will have a record of your subscription in their affiliate back office&mdash;provided that you used their affiliate link to sign up for ClickMagick.<br />
<br />
If they don&rsquo;t show you in their affiliate stats, you can have them assigned as your referrer by&nbsp;contacting our <strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support</a></strong> desk, which you can find at any time in the <strong>Help</strong> menu at the top of every page. Just keep in mind that they will not get credit for any past payments that you have already made.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> If someone else is already listed as your referrer, that cannot be changed. If this has happened, it means that you somehow used this other person&rsquo;s affiliate link by mistake when you signed up. The only way to change referrers in this case is to cancel your existing account and create a new one using the correct affiliate link.</div>
