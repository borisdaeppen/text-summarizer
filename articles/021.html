<b>Can I use my tracking links in emails I send?</b><br />
<br />
Absolutely. Great idea. You definitely should! But there are two little things you need to do first &hellip;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>#1 Read our Anti-Spam Policy</b><br />
<br />
First of all, before you send any emails with tracking links, please read our <b><a href="/user/faqs.cgi?answer=77">Official Anti-Spam Policy</a></b>. Our anti-spam policy is simple&nbsp;and fair, but we&rsquo;re very strict when it comes to enforcing it because spam hurts everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>#2 Set Up a Custom Tracking Domain</b><br />
<br />
If you want to use tracking links in emails, you&rsquo;ll need to set up a custom tracking domain first.<br />
<br />
You may not, under any circumstances, use our generic tracking domains (<code>www.clkmg.com</code> and <code>www.clkmr.com</code>) in any emails that you send. If you&rsquo;re going to send tracking links in email messages, you must use your own custom domain. But don&rsquo;t worry, this only takes a few minutes to set up and is fully explained in this FAQ:<br />

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="box-sizing: border-box; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; max-width: 100%; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
	<tbody style="box-sizing: border-box;">
		<tr style="box-sizing: border-box;">
			<td style="box-sizing: border-box; width: 20px;"><a href="/user/faqs.cgi?answer=140"><img height="20" src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqpage.gif" style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; vertical-align: middle;" width="17" /></a></td>
			<td style="box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;</td>
			<td style="box-sizing: border-box;"><a href="/user/faqs.cgi?answer=140"><b>What is the recommended way to set up a custom domain?</b></a></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<br />
<b>Why It&rsquo;s Smart to Use a Custom Domain</b><br />
<br />
If thousands of users were to send emails all containing links using our generic tracking domains, the domains would quickly end up on various email &ldquo;blacklists.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s simply because no matter how hard we try to enforce the anti-spam policy, there are going to be people who spam anyway. And once one of these people gets the domain tagged as a spammer, everybody gets tagged as a spammer until the situation gets straightened out.<br />
<br />
Experienced online marketers learned long ago to protect themselves by never sharing a domain with other online marketers. It&rsquo;s considered a &ldquo;best practice.&rdquo; That way, if another marketer does something unethical and gets a domain banned or blacklisted, it doesn&rsquo;t affect you.<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with ClickMagick specifically. If you&rsquo;re using any type of service where you&rsquo;re sharing the same domain with other marketers, you should consider using a custom domain to protect yourself. It&rsquo;s just a smart thing to do.<br />
<br />
In addition to that, a relevant custom domain will absolutely help to increase clicks on your links, and that helps you make more money.<br />
<br />
Setting up a custom tracking domain is quick and easy, and once you&rsquo;ve done it you&rsquo;ll never have to worry about your emails being marked as spam unless you send spam yourself.<br />

To set up a custom tracking domain, start with this FAQ:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="box-sizing: border-box; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; max-width: 100%; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
	<tbody style="box-sizing: border-box;">
		<tr style="box-sizing: border-box;">
			<td style="box-sizing: border-box; width: 20px;"><a href="/user/faqs.cgi?answer=140"><img height="20" src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqpage.gif" style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; vertical-align: middle;" width="17" /></a></td>

<b>How is this Important Rule Enforced?</b><br />
<br />
We have our own monitoring systems, and we also use 3rd-party monitoring systems.<br />
<br />
Once we&rsquo;ve detected that you&rsquo;re using ClickMagick&rsquo;s generic domains in emails (or on social media sites also), you will receive a single warning, after which we&rsquo;ll have no choice but to cancel your account &hellip;<br />
<br />
...so please make sure you use a custom domain with any tracking links used in emails (and social media).<br />
<br />
Thanks!
