<strong>What&rsquo;s the difference between click flagging and blocking?</strong><br />
<br />
By default, ClickMagick detects clicks from search engine spiders, anti-virus programs, ad networks, and other automated processes that send clicks to your links that aren&rsquo;t real clicks from real users.<br />
<br />
When these clicks are sent to your links, you can block them, flag them, or do nothing special and simply redirect them as expected.<br />
<br />
You can choose whether to block or flag these clicks using the &ldquo;Bad Clicks&rdquo; settings in the Advanced Settings of each link or rotator.<br />
<br />
You can also specify default settings in the &ldquo;Click Auditing&rdquo; section of your <strong><a href="/user/profile.cgi" target="_blank">Profile Page</a></strong> which&nbsp;will be used whenever you create a new link or rotator.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<strong>Blocked Clicks:</strong><br />
<br />
If you block clicks, they will NOT be redirected and you will not see any indication of them in your stats.<br />
<br />
Instead, blocked clicks will display a generic error page and will not be processed at all. It will look as though the click never happened.<br />
<br />
Just keep in mind that when you block clicks, it can make it difficult to track down some types of problems where your clicks aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;adding up&rdquo; the way you would expect them to. If a click gets blocked, you have no record of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Flagged Clicks:</strong><br />
<br />
Because automated clicks are not &ldquo;real&rdquo; clicks from real people, if you include them in your stats for Total Clicks (TC) and Unique Clicks (UC) they will generate inaccurate values for your conversions and other statistics.<br />
<br />
By default, ClickMagick will separate these click counts so they aren&rsquo;t added to the TC and UC columns of the link or rotator. Instead, they will be added to the FC (Flagged Clicks) column.<br />
<br />
This way, you get a record of both &ldquo;real&rdquo; and automated clicks. To see a list of the automated clicks, simply click on the number in the FC column.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that while the click counts are separated from the TC and UC counts, the clicks themselves are not interfered with in any way and they are processed just like any other click sent to your link or rotator URLs.<br />
<br />
This is worth repeating: If a click is flagged, only its statistics are separated from your primary stats. The click will still be redirected through your link or rotator.<br />
<br />
Because flagged clicks are not added to the TC column, this means that the TC column does NOT show the total number of clicks that the link or rotator has received&mdash;it shows the total number of &ldquo;real&rdquo; clicks received while the FC column shows the number of &ldquo;flagged&rdquo;&mdash;and usually fake&mdash;clicks received.<br />
<br />
So, if you are receiving clicks and the number they say they sent you doesn&rsquo;t match the number in your TC column, it&rsquo;s likely that some of their clicks were detected as automated clicks, separated from your main stats, and added to your FC column instead.<br />
<br />
Or, if you&rsquo;re the one sending clicks, remember that the clicks recorded in the FC column are also being sent.<br />
