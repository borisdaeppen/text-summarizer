<strong>How do I set up a tracking link with a funnel?</strong><br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s really easy to set up a tracking link with a FunnelMagick funnel. Just create an Entry Link to your funnel and use that link as the Primary URL for your tracking link.<br />
<br />
That said, it&rsquo;s really common for people to use the wrong URL for their Primary URL ...<br />
<br />
Instead of setting the Primary URL to the <em>Entry Link</em> of their funnel, they set the Primary URL <em>directly to the first page of their funnel</em>. ClickMagick will track the visits to that first page either way, but it will record the stats differently, which can confuse people.<br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s why&hellip;<br />
<br />
If you send people directly to the first page of the funnel, ClickMagick has no idea which traffic source to attribute the visits to so those clicks are viewed as organic clicks and aren&rsquo;t counted in your&nbsp;stats for traffic sources.<br />
<br />
In the vast majority of cases, users&nbsp;want&nbsp;the stats for visitors who come through a traffic source. In that case, you need to be sure to use an Entry Link to your funnel as the Primary URL of your tracking link.<br />
<br />
These are the steps to properly set up a tracking link with a FunnelMagick funnel:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>1.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
			<td><strong>Verify that your entry page is set up correctly:</strong> Go into the <strong>Funnel Builder</strong> and open the Page settings for your Entry page and confirm that the <strong>Page URL</strong> is the actual URL of the page that your visitors will land on. This <strong>Page URL</strong> setting cannot be a tracking link, a link shortener like bit.ly or TinyURL, or any URL other than the URL for the final destination.<br />
			&nbsp;
			<div class="faq-note"><b>Note:</b> When a visitor lands on your page, ClickMagick looks at the URL of that page and tries to find a funnel in your account that has a page with the same URL.<br />
			<br />
			If ClickMagick&nbsp;can&rsquo;t find such a page, it will look like the page doesn&rsquo;t exist in any funnel&nbsp;(because it doesn&rsquo;t) and the visitor will not be recorded. This is why using a tracking link or any URL other than the final destination won&rsquo;t work as the <strong>Page URL </strong>setting.</div>
			<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>2.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td><strong>Create an Entry link for your funnel:</strong> From the <strong>Funnels</strong> page, click on the Settings menu <img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/gear.png" />&nbsp;to the right of the funnel you&rsquo;re interested in and choose <strong>Entry Links</strong>. If you haven&rsquo;t already created an entry link, create one, then copy the entry link to your clipboard for the next step.<br />
			&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td valign="top"><b>3.</b></td>
			<td>&nbsp;</td>
			<td><strong>Create a Tracking Link:</strong> Click on the <strong>Links</strong> menu at the top of the screen then click on <strong>Create New Link</strong>. Set the <strong>Primary URL</strong> set to the funnel&rsquo;s Entry Link. If you&rsquo;re using a custom domain, choose that from tracking link&rsquo;s drop-down menu. Save the tracking link.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<br />
That&rsquo;s it. You&rsquo;re done!<br />
<br />
If you want to send traffic from more than one traffic source to your funnel, simply create a new entry link and tracking link for each traffic source and drive all traffic through your tracking links.
