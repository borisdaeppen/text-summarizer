<strong>What&rsquo;s the best way to get started with ClickMagick?</strong><br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;re brand new to the idea of &ldquo;tracking&rdquo; to maximize your profits, the very best way to get started with ClickMagick is to first understand WHY you should be tracking, and why you would <em>never</em> even consider doing any type of online marketing without tracking. (Hint: that&rsquo;s the #1 mistake that newbies make.)<br />
<br />
Our founder, Patrick Kelly, wrote a short, but thorough, guide about the magick of tracking:<br />
