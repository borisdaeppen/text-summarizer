<b>Can I use my ClickMagick links on Social Media?</b><br />
<br />
You sure can. There&rsquo;s just something you need to know, and something else you need to do first&hellip;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>#1 Understand We Can&rsquo;t Allow Spamming</b><br />
<br />
Social media sites like Facebook are really cracking down on spammers, and we simply can&rsquo;t allow ClickMagick tracking links to be associated with any type of spamming.<br />
<br />
This includes, but is not limited to, using automated posting methods, or posting ads or other &ldquo;spam&rdquo; links on pages or in groups where they don&rsquo;t belong.<br />
<br />
This is super important to preventing our domains from getting blocked so, unfortunately, we have to be strict on this and it&rsquo;s treated the same as email spamming.<br />
<br />
With that out of the way, here&rsquo;s the other thing &hellip;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>#2 Set Up a Cloaked Custom Tracking Domain</b><br />
<br />
If you want to use ClickMagick links on Facebook (or other social media sites), you&rsquo;ll need to set up a cloaked custom tracking domain first.<br />
<br />
The cloaking is key, so please make sure that you enabled Cloaking when adding your custom domain to ClickMagick &ndash;&nbsp;otherwise your domain will still redirect through our generic domain and you&rsquo;ll have problems.<br />
<br />
The ONLY exceptions are if you&rsquo;re simply giving your URL to another person via a private message, or if you&rsquo;re tracking somethinglike a paid Facebook ad.<br />
<br />
But don&rsquo;t worry&ndash;setting up a cloaked custom domain only takes a few minutes to set up. Please see the FAQ below:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="box-sizing: border-box; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; max-width: 100%;">
	<tbody style="box-sizing: border-box;">
		<tr style="box-sizing: border-box;">
			<td style="box-sizing: border-box; width: 20px;"><a href="/user/faqs.cgi?answer=235"><img height="20" src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqpage.gif" style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; vertical-align: middle;" width="17" /></a></td>

<b>Why You Both Need And Want To Do This</b><br />
<br />
Let&rsquo;s look at a real-world scenario using Facebook as the example&hellip;<br />
<br />
If thousands of users post links on Facebook all using the same ClickMagick domain, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before someone promotes something that Facebook doesn&rsquo;t like and gets our shared tracking domain (<code>www.clkmg.com</code>) or rotator domain (<code>www.clkmr.com</code>)&nbsp;blocked.<br />
<br />
This has happened before, and while we were able to get the domains unblocked by Facebook, there&rsquo;s nothing we can do to 100% prevent it from happening again.<br />
<br />
For this reason, we simply can&rsquo;t allow our generic <code>www.clkmg.com</code>&nbsp;and <code>www.clkmr.com</code>&nbsp;domains to be used &ldquo;naked&rdquo; on Facebook or any other social media site.<br />
<br />
And please understand, it&rsquo;s not just us &hellip;<br />
<br />
JVZoo recently had most of their tracking domains blocked on Facebook&nbsp;and even had their entire Facebook group permanently deleted.<br />
<br />
Lots of other companies are having trouble too. Facebook, in particular, is REALLY cracking down on spammers and people posting links to content that they don&rsquo;t like.<br />
<br />
Based on what we learned from Facebook, we predict in the very near future all trackers and other similar services will require users to use custom domains on Facebook&mdash;most after they find their shared domains blocked too.<br />
<br />
More importantly, you WANT to use a custom tracking domain to help get you the best results possible.<br />
<br />
A relevant custom domain will absolutely help to increase clicks on your links, and that helps you make more money, so for this reason alone, it&rsquo;s a no-brainer.<br />
<br />
Setting up a custom tracking domain is quick and easy. Start with this FAQ:<br />

<br />
<b>How is this important rule enforced?</b><br />
<br />
We have our own monitoring systems, and we also use a few 3rd-party monitoring systems too.<br />
<br />
Once it&rsquo;s detected that you&rsquo;re breaking this rule you&rsquo;ll receive a single warning, after which we&rsquo;ll have no choice but to cancel your account &hellip;<br />
<br />
...so please make sure you use a custom domain with any tracking links you use in social media.<br />
<br />
Thanks!
