<b>What is the IP Manager used for?</b><br />
<br />
The <strong><a href="/user/ipmanager.cgi" target="_blank">IP Manager</a></strong> is found in the <strong>Tools</strong> menu at the top of any page, and this is where you can manually enter IP addresses or IP ranges that you want to flag or block in your <strong><a href="/user/profile.cgi?cat=auditing" target="_blank">User Profile</a></strong> or in the Advanced &ldquo;Bad Clicks&rdquo; Settings of your tracking link or rotator.<br />
<br />
For example, once you have tracking links set up you may want to flag your own IP address so that you don&rsquo;t mess up your stats when you load or test your own pages, etc.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps you&rsquo;re getting a ton of fake or abusive clicks from an IP address that the ClickMagick system either hasn&rsquo;t learned about yet, or one we can&rsquo;t flag globally because it&rsquo;s a dynamic residential IP address used by real people &hellip;<br />
<br />
Just add the IP address in the <strong><a href="/user/ipmanager.cgi" target="_blank">IP Manager</a></strong>&nbsp;, then block your &ldquo;User&rdquo; clicks in your&nbsp;<strong><a href="/user/profile.cgi?cat=auditing" target="_blank">User Profile</a></strong>&nbsp;or in your individual tracking links and rotators&nbsp;and you won&rsquo;t see clicks from that IP address any more.
