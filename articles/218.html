<strong>What types of targeted content does ClickMagick disallow?</strong><br />
<br />
ClickMagick receives clicks from traffic sources and redirects those clicks to &ldquo;content,&rdquo; such as websites, downloads, videos, etc. To prevent fraud and scams, ClickMagick disallows both fraudulent traffic sources and malicious or otherwise unacceptable content.<br />
<br />
Here, we&rsquo;re going to cover the types of content that ClickMagick does not allow you to target in your tracking links and rotators. If you want to learn more about the types of fraudulent <em>traffic</em> that ClickMagick does not allow, you&rsquo;ll want to read this FAQ:<br />

Our mission is to help legitimate marketers, who provide real value to the world, to grow their businesses. With that in mind, there are certain types of websites and other content&nbsp; that you can&rsquo;t promote through ClickMagick:<br />

<strong>What happens if I promote any of these things?</strong><br />
<br />
Please note that we manually review EVERY URL entered into our system. Do it and <em>you will get caught</em>.<br />
<br />
With that being said, you&rsquo;ll normally get at least one warning since you may not be aware that something is wrong. For example, any legitimate site you&rsquo;re promoting could get infected with malware at any time through no fault of your own. In a case like this, we&rsquo;ll ask you to stop promoting the site until the problem is cleaned up.<br />
<br />
Notice that we said &ldquo;normally.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
If you create a new account and the first URL you try to promote with a ClickMagick tracking link or rotator is a phishing site, you can bet your account will be canceled within minutes.<br />
<br />
Also know that if your account is canceled for promoting these types of sites, we&rsquo;ll also permanently ban every custom domain or URL you&rsquo;ve ever used&mdash;so you won&rsquo;t be able to just create another account.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions as to whether something is okay to promote or not, just submit a ticket to our <strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support</a></strong> desk and we&rsquo;ll be happy to take a look. It&rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry.
