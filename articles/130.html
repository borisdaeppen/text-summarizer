<b>How do I open pop up links in a new window?</b><br />
<br />
Depending on how you have things set up, you may not want opt-in forms or links within your pop ups to open in the existing pop up window because it&rsquo;s just too small.<br />
<br />
The solution is to have your forms and/or links open in a new window, by adding <code>target=&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;</code> to your forms and links where appropriate.<br />
<br />
For example, if you have a form tag that looks like this:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<code>((form action=&rdquo;foo.php&rdquo; method=&rdquo;POST&rdquo;))</code><br />
<br />
You just change it to this:<br />
<br />
<code>((form action=&rdquo;foo.php&rdquo; method=&rdquo;POST&rdquo; target=&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;))</code><br />
<br />
Now when the form is submitted, the next page will open in a new full-size browser window for the best user experience.<br />
<br />
You may want to do the same thing with links as well. For example if you have a link that looks like this:<br />
<br />
<code>((a href=&rdquo;foo.php&rdquo;))click here((/a))</code><br />
<br />
You just change it to this:<br />
<br />
<code>((a href=&rdquo;foo.php&rdquo; <strong>target=&rdquo;_blank&rdquo;</strong>))click here((/a))</code><br />
<br />
Just like with the form, this will cause your links to open in a new full-size window.<br />
<br />
If you don&rsquo;t have access to the HTML code for your pop up page to do any of this, you&rsquo;ll have to rely on your content management system or page builder.<br />
<br />
Look for options to open a form and/or a link in a new window, which most decent platforms will support.<br />
<br />
If you can&rsquo;t figure it out you may want to consult their documentation or customer support as they are best able to help you with the specifics.
