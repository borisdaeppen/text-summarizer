<strong>What does &ldquo;Link Name is already in use&rdquo; mean?</strong><br />
<br />
When you create a new link, you have the option of giving it a friendly&nbsp;&ldquo;Link Name&rdquo; to remind you what the tracking link is for:<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The &ldquo;Link Name&rdquo; can be almost anything, but it must be unique.<br />
<br />
So, if you&rsquo;re getting the &ldquo;Link Name is already in use&rdquo; error, it simply means that you have already created another link with exactly the same Link Name.<br />
<br />
To create your new link without getting the error, just change your Link Name slightly so that it&rsquo;s different from the other link you&rsquo;ve already created.<br />
<br />
If you want to find the original link, you can do that by entering the Link name into the Search Box in the upper-right corner above all of the links:<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
If that doesn&rsquo;t find the original link, check that your Link Group is set to &ldquo;All Link Groups&rdquo; as show in the screenshot.
