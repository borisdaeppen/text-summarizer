<strong>Is it possible to get a refund?</strong><br />
<br />
When you signed up for ClickMagick, I made you this promise:<br />
<br />
<img src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqs/faq229guarantee.png" /><br />
<br />
So, if you would like a refund, simply contact us at our <strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support Desk</a></strong>&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ll be happy to cancel your account and issue a refund.<br />
<br />
If you think you got charged for the wrong plan level, and would like to be downgraded to a lower plan and get a refund for the difference, we can do that too. Again, just contact our&nbsp;<strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support Desk</a>.</strong><br />
<br />
We&rsquo;ve put a lot of thought and energy into making ClickMagick a really great service, so if you could take a moment and let us know <em>why</em> you&rsquo;d like a refund, we would be forever grateful. Your feedback could help us make ClickMagick even better for our users.<br />
<br />
Thank You!<br />
