<b>Can I rename my ClickMagick affiliate account?</b><br />
<br />
There are two different types of accounts that you can have with ClickMagick. The first is your <em>user</em> account where you actually use the ClickMagick service, and the other is your <em>affiliate</em> account which is used only for promoting the ClickMagick service to earn commissions.<br />
<br />
To change your affiliate username, simply contact us at our&nbsp;<strong><a href="/user/action/account/help.cgi?action=helpdesk" target="_blank">1-Hour Support</a></strong>&nbsp;desk and let us know what you want to change it to.<br />
<br />
Your new affiliate username must be 4-20 characters, and as long as the name is available we&rsquo;ll be more than happy to change it for you. Send us a couple of choices in case your first choice has already been taken.<br />
<br />
Before changing your affiliate username, be sure to stop any traffic that&rsquo;s directed at your current affiliate link or you may lose traffic that you&rsquo;ve paid for.<br />
