<strong>How do I fix my custom domain propagation problems?</strong><br />
<br />
There are a handful of reasons why you might be experiencing what looks like propagation problems with your custom domain.<br />
<br />
For a true propagation problem, there&rsquo;s actually nothing to fix&mdash;you just need to wait up to 24 hours for the Internet to distribute your new domain settings.<br />
<br />
Here&rsquo;s why &hellip;<br />
<br />
Every server on the Internet has a map that it uses to send requests to different custom domains and those maps aren&rsquo;t updated instantly. That would be horribly inefficient and cause the entire Internet to slow down. Instead, these maps are typically updated every 4 to 24 hours, depending upon the needs of the particular server.<br />
<br />
These days, servers tend to ask for map updates much more frequently than once every 24 hours so it&rsquo;s safe to say that if your domain isn&rsquo;t working properly after 4 hours then you should double-check your settings.<br />
<br />
In other words, you probably don&rsquo;t have a propagation problem, but rather a problem in your settings ...<br />
