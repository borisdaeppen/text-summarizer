<b>How can I publicly share my stats for a link?</b><br />
<br />
Sharing your stats for an individual tracking link or rotator URL with your clients, partners, friends, or just anyone in the general public is easy to do &hellip;<br />
<br />
For a tracking link, just select &ldquo;Public Stats&rdquo; from the drop-down menu to the far right of any link.<br />
<br />
For a rotator URL, simply find the URL in your rotator and click the &ldquo;Share&rdquo; link in the Stats column.<br />
<br />
Either of these will result in a &ldquo;public stats page&rdquo; that you can easily share with anyone by simply giving them the URL to the resulting page.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<div class="faq-tip"><b>Tip:</b> In the &ldquo;Public Stats&rdquo; Settings of your <strong><a href="/user/profile.cgi?cat=publicstats" target="_blank">User Profile</a></strong> you can also customize your public stats pages by adding a custom logo and by optionally displaying a ClickMagick banner that redirects users to your affiliate link.</div>
