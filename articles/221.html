<strong>Why is my page loading so slowly?</strong><br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;re using a ClickMagick link and your page is loading slowly, it rarely has anything to do with ClickMagick. Sadly, many popular Page Builders and even popular affiliate networks load their pages ridiculously slowly.<br />
<br />
You can do a quick test by first loading your destination URL in one browser tab, and then your ClickMagick tracking link in another, and chances are you won&#39;t be able to tell the difference in loading time. That&#39;s because ClickMagick itself is hosted on very expensive, lightning fast servers that redirect to your destination URL nearly instantly.<br />
<br />
So, if your destination page is loading slowly, you&rsquo;ll need to do a little detective work ...<br />
<br />
Fortunately, there&rsquo;s an online tool that makes this detective work a breeze. It&rsquo;s the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/" target="_blank">Pingdom Website Speed Test</a></strong>&nbsp;tool, which will take any URL&nbsp;and analyze the load time of its destination page in several different ways. You can find the tool here:<br />
&nbsp;
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="box-sizing: border-box; border-collapse: collapse; border-spacing: 0px; max-width: 100%;">
	<tbody style="box-sizing: border-box;">
		<tr style="box-sizing: border-box;">
			<td style="box-sizing: border-box; width: 20px;"><a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/" target="_blank"><img height="20" src="//cdn.clickmagick.com/images/user/faqpage.gif" style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; vertical-align: middle;" width="17" /></a></td>
			<td style="box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;</td>
			<td style="box-sizing: border-box;"><b><a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/fpt/" target="_blank">&nbsp;Pingdom Website Speed Test</a></b></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
<br />
When you go to that page, simply enter the destination URL that your ClickMagick link redirects to. If you&rsquo;re using a tracking link, this would be the Primary URL for that link. If it&rsquo;s a rotator URL, enter that URL. The <strong><a href="https://tools.pingdom.com/" target="_blank">Pingdom Website Speed Test</a></strong> tool will give you a summary report that looks something like this:<br />

Once you&rsquo;ve established that your destination URL is loading slowly, you can do further research &hellip;<br />
<br />
If you&rsquo;re using a tool like <strong><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-path/aomidfkchockcldhbkggjokdkkebmdll?hl=en" target="_blank">Redirect Path</a></strong>&mdash;which we highly recommend&mdash;you can check to see whether your URL redirects through other URLs before landing on the final page. Multiple redirections is generally the reason why pages load slowly.<br />
<br />
By using a tool like <strong><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirect-path/aomidfkchockcldhbkggjokdkkebmdll?hl=en" target="_blank">Redirect Path</a></strong>, you can test each URL progressively to determine where the slowdown is occurring so you can work on fixing it.<br />
