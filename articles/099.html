<b>What is the Pixel Debugger used for?</b><br />
<br />
The <strong><a href="/user/pixeltest.cgi" target="_blank">Pixel Debugger</a></strong> is found in the Tools menu under the Tracking Pixels sub-menu and you can use it to test and confirm the proper integration of ClickMagick tracking pixels, as well as view pixels that have &ldquo;fired&rdquo; and see what tracking links the conversions were attributed to.<br />
<br />
If you want to know if you correctly installed a tracking pixel on a certain page, you can simply enter the page&rsquo;s URL into&nbsp;the <strong><a href="/user/pixeltest.cgi" target="_blank">Pixel Debugger</a></strong>&nbsp;and the tool will let you know if it finds a valid Action, Engagement, or Sales tracking pixel on the page!<br />
<br />
You can also see the most recent 500 pixels that have &ldquo;fired&rdquo; within the last 30 days which allows you to see exactly what is going on with your pages.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So, if you think your pixels are firing, but they aren&rsquo;t showing up in the list, then you know to check your pages to make sure that the pixels are in the <code>((body))</code>...<code>((/body))</code> section of your page.<br />
<br />
And if the pixels <em>are</em> showing up in the list, but you&rsquo;re not seeing the conversions in your tracking link, the <strong><a href="/user/pixeltest.cgi" target="_blank">Pixel Debugger</a></strong> will show you which tracking link is actually getting the conversion. Invaluable.<br />
<br />
We definitely recommend that you become familiar using ClickMagick&rsquo;s&nbsp;<strong><a href="/user/pixeltest.cgi" target="_blank">Pixel Debugger</a></strong>!
