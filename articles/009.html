<b>Ok, so how should I best use the pop ups?</b><br />
<br />
Your imagination is the only limit, and it really depends on what you&rsquo;re promoting, but here are a few ideas ...
<ul>
	<li class="feature">Offer a bribe or bonus if the user takes action</li>
	<li class="feature">Promote other related products and services</li>
	<li>Pop up an opt-in form to help build your list</li>
</ul>
You only have a few seconds to do it, but the best suggestion we can give you is to do SOMETHING to try to grab the user&rsquo;s attention.<br />
<br />
Try experimenting with audio or a video!
